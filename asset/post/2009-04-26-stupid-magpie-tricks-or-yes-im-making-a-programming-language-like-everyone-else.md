This blog has been collecting dust for several months now. Not because I haven't
been doing anything, quite the opposite. I've been spending all my free time
hacking on a little programming language project: Magpie.

Yesterday, I finally [put it online where people can get to it][repo]. Feel free
to have a look, although it's got a good ways to go before I'd describe it as
really useful.

I hate "general announcement" blog posts, especially on my blog because it's not
like people read this just to find out what *I'm* doing, so to try to make this
at least a little bit interesting, here's some stupid Magpie tricks: things that
are doable or easy in Magpie that can be a pain in other languages.

## Constructor function references

In Magpie, almost everything is a function, including constructors. Since it
doesn't have an explicit `new` keyword, you can pass around a reference to a
constructor like you can any other function.

```magpie1
// Define a type.
struct Point
    X Int
    Y Int
end

Main (->)
    // Pass the constructor to a function.
    TakeRef fn Point (Int, Int)
end

TakeRef (func fn (Int, Int -> Point))
    // Call the reference.
    def point <- func (1, 2)

    Print (point.X.String + ", " + point.Y.String)
end
```

Try *that* C# and C++!

## Tupled arguments

Functions in Magpie always take a single argument. To pass in multiple
arguments, you use a tuple. Syntactically, it looks the same as other languages,
but does have an interesting side-effect: you can treat the entire batch of
arguments as a single value to be played with:

```magpie1
// Define a function that takes three arguments.
Sum (a Int, b Int, c Int -> Int) a + b + c

Main (->)
    // Calling it looks pretty normal...
    def a <- Sum (1, 2, 3)

    // But you can also do this:
    def tuple <- (1, 2, 3)
    def b <- Sum tuple
    Print b.String

    // Or this:
    def tuple2 <- GetArgs
    def c <- Sum tuple2
    Print c.String
end

// This function returns a tuple.
GetArgs (-> (Int, Int, Int)) (4, 5, 6)
```

## Is that it?

I know, I know. Not exactly mind-blowing. There's still lots of work for me to
do on the language, but it's getting there. At the very least, there's a pretty
readable hand-coded lexer and LL parser in there.
