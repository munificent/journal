I finally got tired enough of dealing with WordPress's admin interface and
writing posts in HTML to do something about it, and I've redone this here blog.
Now it's all [blogofile][]. I can edit in [markdown][] and preview locally. All
of my content is backed up just by pushing it to [github][].

It also got a facelift in the process.

## The new design

The old design was based around a 500 pixel column with 14 pixel text. As
resolutions have grown, that started to look tiny. Now it's 640 pixels wide
using a 16 pixel body font. Like the old site, the new one is designed to
rigidly adhere to a baseline grid. This time, the grid is 24 pixels tall.

I'm using the [Google Font API][fonts] to go beyond the half dozen safe
webfonts, but just barely. Titles are using [Varela Round][], but should
fallback to Georgia and look OK if it's missing.

The old design was a classic two column layout. This time around, I went with a
single column. The entire site is now 640 pixels wide, almost like I was
designing in 1998! I pushed all of the navigation down to the bottom.

Two reasons: First, when reading a post I wanted to remove as much clutter as
possible. I wanted it to feel like reading a book without some constellation of
navigation and social buttons in your peripheral vision vying for your
attention.

And I figured a narrower layout would be more mobile friendly. On my phone, I
think the new design looks pretty nice.

Since this was more or less redoing things from scratch, I probably broke some
stuff. Let me know if you see something busted. In the meantime, I can get back
to actually writing about stuff again!
