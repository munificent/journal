title: "Meltwater: A Color Theme for XCode"
categories: code design
---

Because I'm a visual kind of person, one of the first things I do on a new
machine is get the syntax highlighting in my IDE(s) to something I like. At the
moment, I have a couple of different Macs that I work on, so I needed an easy
way to share my [XCode][] color theme between them. I figured I may as well put
it up on GitHub. And if I'm going to do that, I figured I may as well share it
with the world.

[xcode]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode

The theme is called "Meltwater", and it looks like this:

(I'm also using Raph Levien's beautiful [Inconsolata](http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html) font if you're
wondering.)

You can find the theme [here][]. Save it into your XCode preferences directory
here:

[here]: https://github.com/munificent/support/tree/master/xcode/themes

```text
~/Library/Application Support/XCode/Color Themes
```

Then you should be able to see "Meltwater" in XCode in the list of color
themes. Enjoy!
