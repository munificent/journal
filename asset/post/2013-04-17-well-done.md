*This is kinda like part three of the Iteration Inside and Out posts, so you may
want to check out [part one][] and [part two][] too. But you don't have to.*

Most programming languages have one or two singleton values floating around.
These are special built-in objects that only have a single instance. `null` or
`nil` are common. Some languages put `true` and `false` in the same bucket.
JavaScript, ever the hipster, ironically defines one called
[`undefined`][undefined].

I wanted to talk a little bit about one I just added to my little language
[Magpie][]: a [sentinel value] called `done`. I'm still not certain it's a great
idea, but I'll walk you through my thoughts. If nothing else, maybe it will
serve as a cautionary tale for other, smarter language designers.

## Channels

I ran into the problem that ultimately led to `done` when I started working on
Magpie's concurrency story. Its model is based on [fibers][] and [channels][],
much like [Go][] or other [CSP][]-inspired languages. You can spin up a new
fiber using the `async` keyword:

[fibers]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads
[channels]: http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#channels
[csp]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes
[go]: http://golang.org/

```magpie
async
  print("I'm in another fiber!")
end
```

Fibers are cooperatively scheduled so they only yield to other fibers when they
do something that requires waiting. Usually that means IO. So if you do the
above, you won't see that message get printed until something causes the main
fiber to yield. For example:

```magpie
async
  print("I'm in another fiber!")
end

print("Before")
print("After")
```

This program will create a second fiber (but not switch to it). Then it gets to
`print("Before")` in the main fiber. Since printing is IO, that switches to the
second fiber. That in turn queues up *its* `print` and suspends again, so the
main fiber resumes. Ultimately, it prints:

```
Before
I'm in another fiber!
After
```

You can spin up lots and lots of fibers because they don't use OS threads, just
some memory in the interpreter. This is swell for decoupling stuff and running
things concurrently. But sometimes you do need to coordinate fibers with each
other. For that, we've got channels.

A channel is a simple object that you can send objects into and then receive
them from another channel. You can create one like:

```magpie
var channel = Channel new
```

To send a value along it, just do:

```magpie
channel send("My value")
```

And you can receive it like:

```magpie
var result = channel receive
```

The fun bit is that when a fiber sends a value along a channel, it causes that
fiber to suspend until some *other* fiber shows up to receive the value. A send
doesn't complete until the object has been received. So channels let you not
just communicate but also *synchronize.*

## Show's over, folks

There's one other thing you can do with a channel, you can close it:

```magpie
channel close
```

That puts the channel out of commission and tells everyone that they will
receive no more values from it. The question I ran into was, "What happens to
fibers that are waiting to receive on a channel when it gets closed?" For
example:

```magpie
var channel = Channel new

// Wait for a value and print it.
async print(channel receive)

// From the main fiber, close the channel.
channel close
```

Here, the second fiber is sitting there, relaxing, maybe having a cocktail while
it waits for the channel to spew something forth. But it doesn't, it gets
closed. The fiber shouldn't just stay suspended *forever*, so how should it get
notified?

One option would be have `receive` [throw an error][] when the channel gets
closed. So you'd handle it something like:

[throw an error]: http://magpie-lang.org/error-handling.html

```magpie
async
  do
    print(channel receive)
  catch err is ChannelClosedError then
    print("Sorry, no value for you")
  end
end
```

Actually, any [block][] can have a `catch` clause in Magpie, so the explicit
`do` here is redundant. You'd really just do:

[block]: http://magpie-lang.org/blocks.html

```magpie
async
  print(channel receive)
catch err is ChannelClosedError then
  print("Sorry, no value for you")
end
```

That's not too bad, but consider something a little more fleshed out. In many
cases, you'll receive something from a channel and do different stuff based on
what you get. Channels are often used for *messages* and the specific message
will often cause different behavior. You can imagine something like:

```magpie
var channel = Channel new

async
  var count = 1
  while true do
    match channel receive
      case "inc" then print(count = count + 1)
      case "dec" then print(count = count - 1)
    end
  end
end
```

Here we've got a little concurrent counter that you can send messages to in
order to increment and decrement the value. If it also needs to handle the
channel closing, you'd need to do:

```magpie
async
  var count = 1
  while true do
    match channel receive
      case "inc" then print(count = count + 1)
      case "dec" then print(count = count - 1)
    end
  catch err is ChannelClosedError then
    print("Closed")
  end
end
```

That feels redundant to me. Catching errors is basically [pattern matching][]
(in fact, in Magpie it uses the exact same syntax and semantics as a
[`match`][match] expression), so it feels dumb to have to have *two* matches,
one for the set of normal values and then this extra `catch` for the one special
"no more values" signal.

[pattern matching]: http://magpie-lang.org/patterns.html
[match]: http://magpie-lang.org/pattern-matching.html

It's not just redundant either. Even if you don't care about the channel
closing, you *have* to add the `catch` here. Otherwise, since it's a *thrown*
error, it will unwind the fiber's callstack on you.

Both of those are no fun, so I figured, why not just make `receive` *return* a
value when the channel is closed instead of *throwing* one. Magpie already has
a `null`-like sentinel value called [`nothing`][nothing], so I could just say
`receive` returns `nothing` when the channel is closed.

[nothing]: http://magpie-lang.org/primitives.html#nothing

But that's a bit lame. While `nothing` doesn't appear as often as `null` does
in other languages, it's still a general-purpose "no value here" object that
users need to be free to use anywhere. If `receive` returns `nothing` when the
channel is closed, there'd be no way to explicitly send `nothing` along an open
channel. Receivers wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

## Are we done?

So I made another singleton value: `done`. It exists solely to represent "no
more values". With this, the above code is like:

```magpie
async
  var count = 1
  while true do
    match channel receive
      case "inc" then print(count = count + 1)
      case "dec" then print(count = count - 1)
      case done then print("Closed")
    end
  end
end
```

It may seem weird to have a method return values of different types, but this
is natural in Magpie. The language is dynamically typed, and revolves heavily
around pattern matching. In, say, JavaScript, if you have a function that can
return a number or a string and callers will want to handle those cases
differently you get this ugly code:

```javascript
var result = foo();
if (typeof result === 'number') {
  console.log("number");
} else if (typeof result === 'string') {
  console.log("string");
}
```

In Magpie, that's:

```magpie
match foo()
  case is Num then print("number")
  case is String then print("string")
end
```

Or, since the language is expression-oriented, you could even do:

```magpie
print(match foo()
  case is Num then "number"
  case is String then "string"
end)
```

In fact, because Magpie also has [multimethods][], even this would do the right
thing:

[multimethods]: http://magpie-lang.org/multimethods.html

```magpie
def showType(is Num) print("number")
def showType(is String) print("string")

showType(foo())
```

Where was I? Oh, right. So it's totally kosher to have methods return values of
different types and have callers dispatch on them. That was enough to talk
myself into being OK with `receive` having a sort of ad-hoc variant-like return
value.

## The next iteration

Once I had that, I started fleshing out channels a bit more. One thing I noticed
is that you often read from a channel repeatedly. See that `while true do` loop
up there? That seemed a bit silly. Magpie has `for` loops. Like [most][iterator]
[languages][ienumerator], those are syntactic sugar for an [iteration
protocol][]. If I made channels support that directly, you could do:

[iterator]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html
[ienumerator]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/78dfe2yb.aspx
[iteration protocol]: http://docs.python.org/2/c-api/iter.html

```magpie
async
    var count = 1
    for value in channel receive
        match value
            case "inc" then print(count = count + 1)
            case "dec" then print(count = count - 1)
        end
    end
    print("Closed")
end
```

This protocol has two levels: iter*able* and iter*ator*. The iterable protocol
is for an object that can be iterated: lists, collections, etc. There's just one
method:

```magpie
def (is Iterable) iterate
```

An iterable type specializes `iterate` to return a new iterator for the object.
This lets you iterate over objects without modifying the original object. It
would be pretty weird if you could only use a list in one loop at a time.

In the case of channels, though, iterating it *is* mutating the original object,
so `iterate` on a channel just returns the same object. Channels are both
iterables *and* iterators. The iterat*or* protocol was two methods:

```magpie
def (is Iterator) advance
```

This tries to advance the iterator to the next item and returns `true` if it
found another item.

```magpie
def (is Iterator) current
```

This returns the current item. So there was a two method protocol here. Most
other languages have something similar. You need two methods because one crank
of the iterator needs to return two bits of data: whether or not you're done
iterating, and the next value if you aren't.

I say "*was* a two method protocol" because now that I had this `done` value, I
realized I could simplify it. All I need is `advance`. It returns the next item
if there is one, or `done` if there isn't. The only thing you lose is the
ability to iterate over a collection that actually contains `done` as a value.
But I'm OK with that. That seems like a small thing to give up to get a simpler
protocol.

Now, not only can you use channels any place you work with sequences, but even
implementing your own sequences is a little easier.

## Your favorite functional friends

When I say "any place you work with sequences," much of what I'm thinking of is
those workhorse methods that transform sequences. Good old [`map()`][map],
[`filter()`][filter], [`fold()`][fold], etc. This gives you a feel for what they
look like in Magpie:

[map]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(higher-order_function)
[filter]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(higher-order_function)
[fold]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)

```magpie
var list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list map(fn(i) i * 3) // 3, 6, 9, 12.
list where(fn(i) i % 2 == 0) // 2, 4.
```

Since I specialized these on Iterable, that means any iterable type, including
channels, gets them. For a longer example, Go has [an example][go sieve]
showing a concurrent [Sieve of Eratosthenes][]. Ported to Magpie, it looks like:

[go sieve]: http://golang.org/doc/play/sieve.go
[sieve of eratosthenes]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes

```magpie
// Send the sequence 2, 3, 4, ... to 'channel'.
def generate(channel is Channel) async
  for i in 2..9999 do channel send(i)
end

// Copy the values from 'input' to 'out',
// removing those divisible by 'prime'.
def filter(input is Channel, out is Channel, prime is Int) async
  input where(fn(i) i % prime != 0) pipeTo(out)
end

// The prime sieve: Daisy-chain Filter processes.
var channel = Channel new
generate(channel) // Spawn generate fiber.

for i in 0..50 do
  val prime = print(channel receive)
  val sieve = Channel new
  filter(channel, sieve, prime)
  channel = sieve
end
```

I won't walk you through the whole thing, but I do think it's pretty rad. The
neat bit is this line:

```magpie
input where(fn(i) i % prime != 0) pipeTo(output)
```

Here, `where()` is Magpie's filter function. It takes an iterable on the left
and a predicate function on the right. It returns an iterable generating all of
the items of the original sequence where the predicate returns `true`. Note that
here, the argument on the left is a *channel* so this magically becomes an
*asynchronous* filter.

Likewise, `pipeTo()` is a method that takes an iterable and a channel and sends
all of the values in the iterable to the channel. So we're taking a channel,
filtering it like a collection, then pumping that collection back into a new
channel. This all happens asynchronously, but the code looks like you're just
playing with regular collections.

Crap, I've digressed again. I was supposed to be talking about `done`. I just
think treating channels as sequences is really cool. OK, back to the matter at
hand.

## Now are we done yet?

The simplest of the higher-order methods for working with iterables is `each()`.
All it does is call the given function for each item in the sequence. In other
languages this is sometimes called `forEach()`. Most of the time you don't need
it since it is almost identical to just using a built-in `for` loop. But
sometimes it's convenient, so Magpie has it.

If you've worked with [`forEach()`][foreach] in JavaScript, one nasty problem is
how do you stop early if you don't actually need to walk the whole sequence?
Ruby has some special syntax built into the language, `break` and `next`, that
are designed to work specifically with blocks and iterators. JS ain't so lucky.

Magpie has `break` for `for` loops, but a method like `each` is just a method
that takes a function. You can't `break` from within a function. But... since we
have this `done` value laying around, we can use it here too. So the way
`each()` (and `map()` and `where()` and others) work is if the callback ever
returns `done` that means "stop iterating now".

[foreach]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach

For example:

```magpie
[1, 2, 3, 4] map(fn(i) if i < 3 then i * 2 else done)
```

This will not only transform the values -- what `map()` usually does -- but it
will also truncate the sequence and just return `[2, 4]`.

So we've got an easier way to handle closed channels, a simpler iterator
protocol, and more expressive collection-manipulation methods. Not too bad for
one little sentinel value.
