title: "Conditional Binding with \"let\" in Magpie"
tags: code language magpie

Magpie, as an imperative language, has the usual control flow structures you
expect to see: `while`, `if`, and `for` (although they're a little different
from their C counterparts). However, Magpie has one other control flow construct
you probably haven't seen before: `let then`, the conditional binder.

## A motivating example or two

Before I explain it, let's go over a couple of examples in other languages where
it would be useful. First up: converting strings to other types. In C#, you'd do
something like:

```csharp
int value = Int32.Parse("1234");
// Do something with value...
```

That's fine and dandy except that the parse can fail and throw an exception.
If you don't want to deal with the exception, the easier solution is to use
the conveniently provided `TryParse` function:

```csharp
int value;
if (Int32.TryParse("1234", out value))
{
    // Do something with value...

}
```

That's the idiomatic way to convert strings to ints in C#. Aside from the
cumbersome out parameter, what's lame about this code is that `value` is scoped
*outside* of the `if` block where we actually want to use it. If the conversion
fails, we have this weird unassigned `value` variable floating around.

Here's another example: downcasting. Let's say we have a variable of type `Base`
and we want to downcast it to a `Derived` subclass. The normal way to do that
is:

```csharp
Derived derived = someBase as Derived;
if (derived != null)
{
    // Do something with derived...
}
```

A third and final example: looking up a value in a dictionary. If you aren't
sure the key exists, the typical solution is:

```csharp
Dictionary<string, int> dict = // Get dictionary...

int value;
if (dict.TryGetValue("key", out value))
{
    // Do something with value...
}
```

You're seeing the pattern by now. All of these have the exact same structure.
We have some operation that may return a value or may fail for some reason. If
it succeeds, we want to do something with the returned value.

## Let

The `let` keyword in Magpie lets you implement that pattern directly, without
the gross scoping issues or output parameters. The above examples in Magpie look
like this:

```magpie1
// Parse:
let value <- "1234".AsInt then
    // Do something with value...
end

// Downcast:
let derived <- someBase.As'Derived then
    // Do something with derived...
end

// Look up in dictionary:
let value <- Find (dict, "key") then
    // Do something with value.
end
```

The way this works is pretty simple. Magpie has an `Option` type, which is the
same as F#'s [option][] or Haskell's [Maybe][]. A `let` expression looks like:

[option]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233245%28VS.100%29.aspx
[maybe]: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Hierarchical_libraries/Maybe

```magpie1
let <variable> <- <expression> then <body>
```

The `<expression>` is expected to return an `Option` value. If it evaluates to
`Some`, then the value is extracted and assigned to `<variable>` and the
`<body>` is evaluated. If `None` is returned instead, the variable isn't bound
and the body is skipped. Pretty straightforward.

What's nice about this syntax is that the bound variable is scoped to the body
of the `let` expression and disappears afterwards. This means that if the
expression fails and returns `None`, the variable disappears entirely. It's
syntactically impossible to access that variable when it has no value.

## What else?

Because `let` is essentially another kind of `if`, it also supports an `else`
clause:

```magpie1
// Parse:
let value <- "1234".AsInt then
    // Do something with value...
else
    Print "Couldn't parse string."
end
```

## A bit on naming

I probably spend more time than I should thinking about the minutia of language
syntax. I chose `let` because to me that implies *permission*: it *may* "let"
you do something or it may not, which lines up with the conditional nature of
the construct. Using `then` to separate the expression from the body both
reinforces that this is an "if-like" conditional block and lets me reuse an
existing keyword.

Of course, programmers of the ML-family will likely recognize `let` as a poor
man's pattern matching. This isn't far from the truth, but I do think Magpie's
"light" version is kind of nice in its own regard.
