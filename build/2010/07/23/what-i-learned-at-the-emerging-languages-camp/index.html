</h4>

<p>I just got back from the unbelievably awesome Emerging Languages Camp at
<a href="http://www.oscon.com/">OSCON</a>. I wish I could come up with a good way to get across how cool of an
experience it was. All I can say was that for the first time in a long time, I
felt like I was really around my people. A programming language nerd is a really
specific kind of nerd and I don&rsquo;t really know many who share my obsession. For
the last two days, I was in a room packed with people who did.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to summarize two intense days of full-on nerdery, but I thought I
would talk a bit about something good I got from some of the talks. This doesn&rsquo;t
mean I agreed with them all (frankly, I found the Go talk myopic), or that
anyone I omitted here <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> interesting. I&rsquo;m exhausted this morning, so I
only have so much steam.</p>

<h2>Rob Pike (Go)</h2>

<p>The theme that comes up frequently when I read about <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a> or hear Rob talk
about it is this sense of pragmatic feature economy. Any time someone asks, &ldquo;why
doesn&rsquo;t Go have Foo&rdquo;, his answer tends to be &ldquo;We found in practice that we don&rsquo;t
miss it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Language designers can be <a href="http://magpie-lang.org">magpies</a>, wanting to cram in all of our favorite
features just because they&rsquo;re shiny or to have a longer bullet list than the
competition. If those features don&rsquo;t help real people solve real problems,
you&rsquo;re wasting your time and making things more complex for them. While I don&rsquo;t
always agree with the specific choices that the Go designers make, I do agree
with the &ldquo;let&rsquo;s see if we can get by without them&rdquo; approach that leads to them.</p>

<h2>Phil Mercurio (Thyrd)</h2>

<p>Phil&rsquo;s talk was one of a few on visual programming. Most of my experience with
visual languages is that they&rsquo;re either toys or incomprehensible timecube-esque
crankware.</p>

<p>Phil got up and humbly walked through <a href="http://thyrd.org/">his visual language</a>. When he
asked for questions at the end, there was a long pause before any hands went up.
From talking to people afterward, I think the consensus was that we were all
thinking, &ldquo;Holy crap, he actually did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He managed to find a small kernel for a visual language (nested grids and
triads) and build something out of it that really works. It&rsquo;s <em>really</em> hard to
pull something like this off, and I think it&rsquo;s cool that&rsquo;s he had the insight
and tenacity to keep cranking away at it.</p>

<h2>Alan Eliasen (Frink)</h2>

<p>Alan stressed that <a href="http://futureboy.homeip.net/frinkdocs/">Frink</a> is a general-purpose language with user-defined
functions and stuff but its <em>raison d&rsquo;etre</em> is doing arithmetic with units,
which it does so unbelievably comprehensively that it boggles the mind. From his
talk, I can only assume that Alan&rsquo;s house is packed floor-to-ceiling with
yellowing almanacs and dusty IEEE standards reports. Calling his knowledge of
measure &ldquo;encyclopedic&rdquo; is giving encyclopedias too much credit.</p>

<p>What I found interesting about Frink is that by limiting its focus to a single
domain, Alan has ended up with a language that&rsquo;s <em>more</em> powerful and useful.
When asked what their language is good for, many designers would say
&ldquo;everything&rdquo; which really means &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;. Frink embodies the principle of doing
one thing and doing it well.</p>

<h2>Gilad Bracha (Newspeak)</h2>

<p>The camp was an even mix of academics and hackers. A lot of academic talk is
over my head so the mortarboard team is underrepresented in this post. Gilad&rsquo;s
talk was in that category: a lot of it was too high-level for my primitive
monkey brain to grasp.</p>

<p>One thing really stuck with me though. <a href="http://bracha.org/Site/Newspeak.html">Newspeak</a> doesn&rsquo;t have namespaces,
modules, or a lot of other OOP features. What it does have is classes, and
classes nest. That simple core is flexible enough to do duty as a module system,
an abstraction system, a namespace system etc. I love the idea of getting one
simple concept and letting it fully unfold to cover a bunch of different problem
solutions.</p>

<h2>Jeremy Ashkenas (Coffeescript)</h2>

<p>I totally didn&rsquo;t pay attention to Jeremy&rsquo;s talk because I was busy slapping
together slides for mine. This sucks because I think <a href="https://coffeescript.org/">Coffeescript</a> is
fantastic. I love its obsession with aesthetics and clarity. Both the language
and its documentation are a testament to the philosophy that beautiful is
usable. I wish more language designers would pay heed to that.</p>

<h2>Steve Folta (Trylon)</h2>

<p>Steve&rsquo;s talk embodied two ideals that I think are often overlooked. The first
thing he said when he got up was, &ldquo;Trylon doesn&rsquo;t do anything new.&rdquo; That puts
<a href="http://github.com/stevefolta/trylon">Trylon</a> in the same space as Python, Ruby, and almost every popular language
today. If you want to publish papers and advance the art, breaking new ground is
key. If you want a language for people to use, there&rsquo;s real value in staying
away from the borderlands.</p>

<p>The other thing he said that struck me was, &ldquo;When I get home I program in Trylon
because it&rsquo;s the language that feels the most fun to me.&rdquo; A well-worn truism in
writing is &ldquo;write for yourself&rdquo;. Trying to make a language that&rsquo;s all things to
all people is futile and exhausting. I love that Steve just made the language
that <em>he</em> wanted.</p>

<h2>Amos Wenger (ooc)</h2>

<p>Any domain has two levels of knowledge: the core ideas for the domain, and the
<em>cultural</em> wisdom <em>around</em> those ideas. The first tells you how to do stuff. The
latter often tells you which stuff not to do. Any well-versed programming
language person can tell you about both recursive-descent parsers and generated
parsers. They&rsquo;ll also tell that generated parsers are the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to do
that.</p>

<p>Most of the time that advice will save you from wasted effort, but sometimes I
think it keeps people from going down paths that may actually be fruitful.
Sometimes the thing that everyone knows is true isn&rsquo;t. (For example, every
language I know of with a lot of real-world users actually does use a hand-
written parser.)</p>

<p>Amos is a young French iconoclast. If he&rsquo;d been born in a different time, I
expect he&rsquo;d be a brick-tossing anarchist. One advantage that attitude gives him
is that he and the others working on <a href="http://ooc-lang.org/">ooc</a> pour features into the language
while the rest of us are still sitting around fretting about minutia. I think a
lot of us could use some of that &ldquo;let&rsquo;s just fucking do it&rdquo; spirit.</p>
