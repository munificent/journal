</h4>

<p>Every fledgling programming language exists somewhere on the continuum between
&ldquo;scratchings in a notebook&rdquo; and &ldquo;making Java nervous&rdquo;. Right now, Magpie is
farther to the right than total vaporware, but it&rsquo;s not yet at the point where
I actually want people to use it (though you&rsquo;re certainly <a href="https://github.com/munificent/magpie">welcome to
try</a>). The big reason for that is that there&rsquo;s some core pieces I&rsquo;m still
figuring out. Without those in place, any attempts to use the language will
either fail or just be invalidated when I change something.</p>

<p>The biggest piece of that is the object system: how classes work. The two
challenging parts of <em>that</em> are inheritance and constructors. I think I&rsquo;ve got
a few ideas that are finally starting to stick there, so I thought I&rsquo;d start
documenting them to make sure I&rsquo;ve got it clear in my head, and hopefully get
some feedback.</p>

<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll just worry about constructors. The way Magpie handles
constructing instances of classes is a bit… uh… odd. I&rsquo;ll explain
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/">Memento</a>-style, starting with the end and working backwards to see how I
got there. By the end (or is it the beginning?) it should hopefully make
sense.</p>

<h2>Making an Object</h2>

<p>To see where we end up, here&rsquo;s a simple class in Magpie:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-magpie" data-lang="magpie"><span></span><span class="n">class</span> <span class="n">Point</span>
    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="err">x</span> <span class="n">Int</span>
    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="err">y</span> <span class="n">Int</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Pretty basic. It has two fields. Because those fields don&rsquo;t have initializers
(i.e. they aren&rsquo;t like <code>var z = 123</code>), they need to get those values passed
in. Given that class up there, you can do that and make an instance like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-magpie" data-lang="magpie"><span></span><span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">point</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Point</span> <span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">x:</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="err">y:</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t look very special. So <code>new</code> is just a static method on a class,
and you pass in named arguments? That&rsquo;s half right. <code>new</code> is just a static
(&ldquo;shared&rdquo; in Magpie-ese) method. Magpie doesn&rsquo;t have named arguments. What it
has are <em>records</em>. The above is identical to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-magpie" data-lang="magpie"><span></span><span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">coords</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="err">x:</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="err">y:</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">point</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Point</span> <span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">coords</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Records in Magpie are as they are in ML: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural*type*system">structurally-typed</a> anonymous
structs. A series of <code>keyword: value</code> pairs forms a single expression that
evaluates to a record value. Sort of like object literals in Javascript,
although they&rsquo;re statically-typed in Magpie.</p>

<p>So, this is pretty straightforward. When you define a class, it automatically
gets a shared method called <code>new</code> that expects a record with fields that match
all of the required fields of the class?</p>

<p>Well, sort of. Actually, <code>new</code> doesn&rsquo;t do much at all. It&rsquo;s just:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-magpie" data-lang="magpie"><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">construct</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>OK, so what&rsquo;s <code>construct</code>?</p>

<h2>Raw Constructors</h2>

<p>Raw constructors are the real way that instances of a named class are created
in Magpie. Each class automatically gets a shared <code>construct</code> method. That
method (like <code>new</code>) takes a record with fields for all of the fields of the
class. It then builds an instance of the class and copies those field values
over.</p>

<p>So raw constructors are the real way that instances of a class are created in
Magpie. So what is <code>new</code> for then?</p>

<h2>A Time To Initialize</h2>

<p>Calling <code>construct</code> is the raw way to create an instance, but many (most?)
classes need to perform some initialization when an instance is created, or
maybe they&rsquo;ll calculate the values of some of the fields instead of just
taking them in as arguments. <code>new</code> exists to give you a place to do that.</p>

<p>For example, lets say we actually wanted to create points using polar
coordinates, even though it stores Cartesian. In that case, we could define it
like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-magpie" data-lang="magpie"><span></span><span class="n">class</span> <span class="n">Point</span>
    <span class="n">shared</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">theta</span> <span class="n">Int</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">radius</span> <span class="n">Int</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Point</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">var</span> <span class="err">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cos</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">theta</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">radius</span>
        <span class="k">var</span> <span class="err">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">theta</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">radius</span>
        <span class="n">construct</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">x:</span> <span class="err">x</span> <span class="err">y:</span> <span class="err">y</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="err">x</span> <span class="n">Int</span>
    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="err">y</span> <span class="n">Int</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see <code>new</code> is basically a factory method. It does some calculation,
and then the very last thing it does is call <code>construct</code>, the <em>real</em> way to
create an object, and returns the result. (Like Ruby, a function implicitly
returns the result of its last expression.)</p>

<p>The reason Magpie always gives you <em>both</em> <code>construct</code> and <code>new</code> is for
<a href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2010/09/18/futureproofing-uniform-access-and-masquerades/">forward-compatibility</a>. <code>new</code> is the way you should generally be creating
instances, so it gives you a default one that forwards to <code>construct</code>. If you
later realize you need to do more initialization than just a straight call to
<code>construct</code>, you can replace <code>new</code> without having to change every place you&rsquo;re
creating an object.</p>

<h2>OK, But Why?</h2>

<p>So that seems pretty strange. Why on Earth would I design things this way
instead of just using normal constructors like most other languages?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine that Magpie <em>did</em> have normal constructors (which it did until a
few days ago, actually). Let&rsquo;s translate our Point class to use that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-magpie" data-lang="magpie"><span></span><span class="n">class</span> <span class="n">Point</span>
    <span class="c1">// &#39;this&#39; here defines a constructor method</span>
    <span class="n">this</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">x</span> <span class="n">Int</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="err">y</span> <span class="n">Int</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">this</span> <span class="err">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="err">x</span>
        <span class="n">this</span> <span class="err">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="err">y</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="err">x</span> <span class="n">Int</span>
    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="err">y</span> <span class="n">Int</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Pretty straightforward, and it works fine. Now let&rsquo;s break it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-magpie" data-lang="magpie"><span></span><span class="n">class</span> <span class="n">Point</span>
    <span class="n">this</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">x</span> <span class="n">Int</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="err">y</span> <span class="n">Int</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">this</span> <span class="err">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="err">x</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="err">x</span> <span class="n">Int</span>
    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="err">y</span> <span class="n">Int</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, we&rsquo;re failing to initialize the <code>y</code> field. What is its value? We can fix
that the way Java does with <code>final</code> fields by statically checking for
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/first*edition/html/16.doc.html">definite assignment</a>. Part of the type-checking process will be to walk
through the constructor function and make sure every declared field in the
class gets assigned to. This isn&rsquo;t rocket science, and I went ahead and
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/munificent/magpie/src/74a3467d69c1/src/com/stuffwithstuff/magpie/interpreter/DefiniteFieldAssignment.java">implemented that</a> in Magpie too.</p>

<p>So we&rsquo;re good, right? Well, what about this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-magpie" data-lang="magpie"><span></span><span class="n">class</span> <span class="n">Point</span>
    <span class="n">this</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">x</span> <span class="n">Int</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="err">y</span> <span class="n">Int</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">doSomethingWithAPoint</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">this</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">this</span> <span class="err">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="err">x</span>
        <span class="n">this</span> <span class="err">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="err">y</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="err">x</span> <span class="n">Int</span>
    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="err">y</span> <span class="n">Int</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In the constructor, we&rsquo;re passing <code>this</code> to another function. That function,
reasonably enough, expects the Point it receives to be fully initialized, but
at this point it isn&rsquo;t. So that&rsquo;s bad.</p>

<p>We can fix that by making the static analysis even more comprehensive. While
we check for definite assignment, we&rsquo;ll also track and make sure that <code>this</code>
isn&rsquo;t used until all fields are definitely assigned.</p>

<p>Of course, you need to be able to use <code>this</code> to actually assign the fields. So
we&rsquo;ll need to special-case that. At this point, it starts to look like we&rsquo;re
building some ad-hoc typestate system where the static &ldquo;type&rdquo; of <code>this</code>
mutates as we walk through the body of the constructor and gets tagged with
all of the fields that have been assigned to it. Like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-magpie" data-lang="magpie"><span></span><span class="n">this</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">x</span> <span class="n">Int</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="err">y</span> <span class="n">Int</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="c1">// here &#39;this&#39; is &quot;Point with no fields assigned&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">this</span> <span class="err">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="err">x</span>
    <span class="c1">// now it&#39;s &quot;Point with x&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">this</span> <span class="err">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="err">y</span>
    <span class="c1">// now it&#39;s &quot;Point with x and y&quot; and we&#39;re good</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is doable, but it&rsquo;s a bit of a chore to implement. Much worse is that
it&rsquo;s a real chore for any (purely hypothetical at this point) Magpie user to
have to know. In order to understand the weird type-check errors you can get
in a constructor, you&rsquo;ll have to fully understand all of this flow analysis I
just described.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to keep Magpie as simple as I can, and this is definitely not it.</p>

<h2>Why Don&rsquo;t Other Languages Have This Problem?</h2>

<p>Here is where we get to the real motivation that leads to all of this. Java
and C# don&rsquo;t have this issue with their constructors. It&rsquo;s perfectly valid to
do this in Java:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span></span><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Point</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="nf">Point</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="n">doSomethingWithPoint</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="o">);</span>
        <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">;</span>
        <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>

    <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kd">final</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kd">final</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad form, but it&rsquo;s safe. The reason why is because Java has <em>default
initialization</em>. Before you ever assign to a field in Java, it still has a
well-defined value. Numbers are 0, booleans are false, and reference types are
<code>null</code>.</p>

<p>Whoops! That last one is a <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3186">doozy</a>. I <em>hate</em> having to check for <code>null</code> at
runtime. One of the major motivations for designing Magpie was to have it
<a href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2010/08/23/void-null-maybe-and-nothing/">statically eliminate</a> the need for those. If I say a variable is of type
<code>Monkey</code>, I want it to always be a <em>monkey</em>, not &ldquo;possibly a monkey, but also
possibly this other magical missing monkey value&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The problem then is that it isn&rsquo;t always possible to create a value of some
arbitrary type <em>ex nihilo</em>. We can&rsquo;t just default initialize a field of
<code>Monkey</code> by creating a new monkey from scratch. Maybe it needs arguments to be
constructed.</p>

<p>So default initialization has to go. Every field in an instance of a class
will need to be explicitly initialized before anyone can use that instance. In
other words, until its fully set-up, <code>this</code> is verboten.</p>

<p>(C++ has its own solution for this, of course: constructor initialization
lists. They solve this problem neatly, but at the expense of adding a non-
trivial amount of complexity to the language.)</p>

<p>The most straight-forward solution I could come up with was this: <em>create the
instance as a single atomic operation</em>. To do this, we&rsquo;ll need to pass in
<em>all</em> of the fields the instance needs, and it will return us a fully-
initialized ready-to-use object. That&rsquo;s <code>construct</code>.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s nice about this is that it&rsquo;s dead-simple. There&rsquo;s almost no special
support in Magpie for constructors. No syntax for defining them. No special
definite assignment for tracking that fields are initialized. Just a single
built-in <code>construct</code> method auto-generated by the interpreter for each class,
and you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not all rosy, though. Doing things this way can be kind of gross if your
class has a lot of fields to initialize. You end up having to build a big
record as the last expression in your <code>new</code> method.</p>

<p>The other challenge is that circular immutable data structures aren&rsquo;t really
feasible. (Magpie doesn&rsquo;t have immutable fields yet, but it will.) Haskell has
it even worse than Magpie since <em>everything</em> is immutable and it&rsquo;s actually
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Tying*the*Knot">surprisingly tricky</a> to solve it.</p>

<p>What may be the biggest drawback, though, is that it&rsquo;s unusual. Unfamiliarity
is its own steep cost, especially in a fledgling language.</p>

<h2>Rewind</h2>

<p>So, going from cause to effect, it&rsquo;s:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To get rid of null references, I had to get rid of default initialization.</p></li>
<li><p>To get rid of default initialization, I had to get rid of access to <code>this</code>
before an object has been fully-constructed.</p></li>
<li><p>To do that, I turned construction into a single <code>construct</code> method that
takes all of the required state and returns a new instance all in one step.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, to get user-defined initialization back, I wrapped that in a <code>new</code>
method that you can swap out to do what you want.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The reasoning seemed pretty sound to me, but I&rsquo;m always eager to hear what
others think about it.</p>
