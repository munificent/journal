</h4>

<p>I got started hacking on my own roguelike after spending several years avidly playing <a href="http://rephial.org/">Angband</a>. Like most projects, I had a few itches I wanted to scratch and it kind of took on a life of its own. One thing that annoyed me about Angband was how monsters dropped loot when they died.</p>

<p>In Angband, any monster that drops stuff can drop pretty much anything. Monsters have a level, and if they drop loot, it just randomly picks any item near the monsters level. This bugged me for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>It felt flavorless and unrealistic.</strong> For example, the description of a novice mage is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>The Novice mage  (Red &#39;p&#39;)
=== Num:38  Lev:2  Rar:1  Spd:+0  Hp:6d4  Ac:6  Exp:6
He is leaving behind a trail of dropped spell components.
</code></pre></div>
<p>But when you hack one to pieces, he&rsquo;s as likely to drop a sword as he
is anything magical. This makes monsters feel too similar each other: each one is basically a spin on the one giant Wheel Of Loot.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It made it impossible for the player to seek certain items.</strong> Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve got a good kit of armor except you really could use some high quality boots. How do you fill in that gap?</p>

<p>In Angband, the answer is &ldquo;kill a whole ton of stuff and wade through piles of loot you don&rsquo;t care about&rdquo;. Especially near the end game where you&rsquo;re looking for just a few specific pieces of gear, you spend a <em>lot</em> of time just killing dragons and hunting through mountains of loot. 95% of it gets left on the ground.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I wanted to solve this by making different monsters drop different stuff. Kill a warrior, and you should get weapons and armor. Kill a wizard, get wands and scrolls.</p>

<h2>Monster-specific loot</h2>

<p>My first pass at this was to give each monster its own set of drops. I had already made monsters data-driven. I came up with my own little text format so monsters were defined in text something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>dwarf miner
    color     = DarkGray
    depth     = 22
    health    = 44
    attacks
        hammers = 15t5
    description
        Covered from head to toe is dust and dirt, you can barely
        make out the form of this weary dwarf.
</code></pre></div>
<p>For each monster (or at least, each one that drops loot), I added a &ldquo;drops&rdquo; section, like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>drops
    hammer (50%)
</code></pre></div>
<p>And, behold, kill a dwarven miner and there&rsquo;s a fifty-fifty chance he&rsquo;ll drop a hammer. But dwarves like gems too, right? So I added that in too. Only the problem is that there&rsquo;s a bunch of different kinds of gems, so I ended up with something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>drops
    hammer (50%)
    amethyst (10%)
    sapphire (7%)
    emerald (4%)
    ruby (3%)
    diamond (2%)
    blue diamond (1%)
</code></pre></div>
<p>It uses the percentages to pick one of the drops. Notice how the better gems are rarer? That&rsquo;s fine for a miner, which is a pretty weak dwarf, but a dwarf chieftan should tend to drop better gems:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>drops
    amethyst (3%)
    sapphire (5%)
    emerald (8%)
    ruby (10%)
    diamond (8%)
    blue diamond (5%)
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now consider that there&rsquo;s a few different types of hammers too&hellip; Things got pretty nasty pretty quickly. It was a huge chore to maintain these giant tuned drop tables for each of potentially hundreds of monsters. Ugh.</p>

<p>The first thing I realized was that there was a lot of overlap between monsters. Dwarven miners and dwarven warriors drop the same gems with the same frequency. So I made &ldquo;macros&rdquo; in my drop language. I could define:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>(gem)
    hammer (50%)
    amethyst (10%)
    sapphire (7%)
    emerald (4%)
    ruby (3%)
    diamond (2%)
    blue diamond (1%)
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then in dwarven miner and warrior, just add:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>drops
    (gem)
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>(gem)</code> would then expand to that little weighted table of gems. That worked fine when the probabilities of each gem were the same, but it meant I couldn&rsquo;t reuse these tables across dwarves of different <em>difficulty</em>. Stronger dwarves drop the same gems but with different probabilities.</p>

<p>So I came up with a different kind of drop that selects from a bunch of child drops based on <em>level</em>. This let me define:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>(gem)
    one near level
        amethyst (23)
        sapphire (38)
        emerald (52)
        ruby (62)
        diamond (87)
        blue diamond (95)
</code></pre></div>
<p>The &ldquo;one near level&rdquo; part would take the monster&rsquo;s level into account, plus a bit of randomness, to pick child drop from within it. Now I could reuse <code>(gem)</code> across a range of different difficulties. Of course, I still had to define lots of tables for all of these different &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; of drops. There was a table for gems, stones, hammers, daggers, etc. Piles of data.</p>

<p>After all of that, I found it wasn&rsquo;t fun to play. The problem was that even with these tables, killing a monster was&hellip; <em>boring</em>. Every time you killed a drwarf, you knew what you were going to get. You might get a better gem (yay), but nothing surprising.</p>

<h2>Simpler Sequences</h2>

<p>A few years ago, I ported the game to <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a>. When I did, I tried to simplify as many things as I could. I didn&rsquo;t want to rewrite this whole giant DSL macro language thing. Instead, I noticed that every item seemed to be a member of some sequence. Emeralds are always in a sequence of gems, a hammer is in a sequence with warhammers and mattocks, etc.</p>

<p>Instead of building some complex general-purpose loot DSL and then implementing this logic using that, I just built sequences directly into the loot code. When defining a monster (now we&rsquo;re in Dart code), you&rsquo;d list the drops:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-dart" data-lang="dart"><span></span><span class="n">breed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;goblin peon&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">lightBrown</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">16</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="n">attack</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;stab[s]&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">6</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">],</span> <span class="nl">drop:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="n">chanceOf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Spear&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">]);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The &ldquo;Spear&rdquo; means it tends to drop spears. But it also implicitly means it can drop other items in the same sequence that spears are in. This lets you express both a sequence and how deep into the sequence a monster should tend to drop. To have a stronger monster drop items from the deep end of the sequence, just name an item from that end.</p>

<p>This let me express pretty much what I could before, but it was a hell of a lot simpler. The only limitation is that an item could only be a part of one sequence. In practice, that works OK.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, though, it didn&rsquo;t solve the boringness problem. I learned the hard way that a huge part of the fun of roguelikes is the &ldquo;lottery effect&rdquo;. Every time you kill a monster there should be a small chance of getting something really amazing. That &ldquo;maybe this one will be the big one&rdquo; anticipation is one of the key emotions in the game.</p>

<p>With sequences, you could get something good, but never something <em>surprising</em>. Eventually, I hit upon a solution and, so far, I really like it.</p>

<h2>Item Groups</h2>

<p>Instead of sequences of items, I now have a <em>hierarchy</em> of them. So, for example, a stilleto is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>equipment/weapon/dagger/Stilleto
</code></pre></div>
<p>I&rsquo;m not generally a fan of hierarchies but I found it surprisingly easy to lump almost every item into one. Items also have a &ldquo;level&rdquo;, which describes their relative value. Higher level stuff is better.</p>

<p>When specifying a drop for a monster, I can specify an item name to drop that specific item. But I can also specify the name of part of the path and a level, like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-dart" data-lang="dart"><span></span><span class="n">breed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;goblin peon&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">lightBrown</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">16</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="n">attack</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;stab[s]&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">6</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">],</span> <span class="nl">drop:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="n">chanceOf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;spear:3&quot;</span><span class="p">),</span>
  <span class="n">chanceOf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;healing:2&quot;</span><span class="p">),</span>
<span class="p">],</span> <span class="nl">meander:</span> <span class="m">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nl">flags:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;few open-doors&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>&quot;spear:3&quot;</code> means &ldquo;drop something from the &lsquo;spear&rsquo; group around level 3&rdquo;. You don&rsquo;t have to specify the entire path since path components are unique. So &ldquo;spear&rdquo; is equivalent to &ldquo;equipment/weapon/spear&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So far, this is pretty much equivalent to the sequences from before. The neat part is what happens when the drop is generated. When picking an item, there&rsquo;s a small chance that it will walk up the group chain. So &ldquo;spear:3&rdquo; will usually drop a spear, but there&rsquo;s a chance it will drop any weapon (the parent group). There&rsquo;s an even smaller chance it will drop any piece of equipment (the grandparent).</p>

<p>Any monster has a chance of dropping almost any item, so you have that pleasant anticipation. At the same time, the probabilities are weighted so that each monster still has a unique &ldquo;feel&rdquo; to their drops, and you can seek out monsters that are more likely to drop what you want.</p>

<p>When specifying a drop, you can also directly specify one of the parent groups. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-dart" data-lang="dart"><span></span><span class="n">breed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;goblin warrior&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">gray</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">32</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="n">attack</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;stab[s]&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">14</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">],</span> <span class="nl">drop:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="n">chanceOf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;equipment:6&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">],</span> <span class="nl">meander:</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nl">flags:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;protective open-doors&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, the <code>&quot;equipment:6&quot;</code> means a goblin may drop <em>any</em> kind of equipment. This makes it really easy to specify monsters that define wide sets of drops. That&rsquo;s good for high level boss monsters that can serve up an assortment of loot.</p>

<p>At the same time, defining the items is pretty simple. You basically just need to categorize and assign a level for each item. It looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-dart" data-lang="dart"><span></span><span class="n">group</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">r&quot;\&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;equipment/weapon/spear&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">weapon</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Pointed Stick&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">brown</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;stab[s]&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">7</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">weapon</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Spear&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">25</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">gray</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;stab[s]&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">12</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">weapon</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Angon&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">35</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">lightGray</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;stab[s]&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">16</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">weapon</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Lance&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">45</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">white</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;stab[s]&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">24</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">weapon</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Partisan&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">55</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">darkGray</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;stab[s]&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">36</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>(The numbers after the name are their levels.) Once you do that, all of the rest of the drop behavior falls out naturally. If I add a new item to an existing group, every monster will then start dropping it, with the right probabilities.</p>
