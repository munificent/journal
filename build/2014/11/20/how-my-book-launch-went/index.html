</h4>

<p>Greetings, superfans! When we <a href="/2014/11/03/bringing-my-web-book-to-print-and-ebook/">last tuned in</a>, I was just about to
&ldquo;launch&rdquo; <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/">my self-published book</a>. I put that in quotes because it&rsquo;s an
awfully serious-sounding word for what was really just doing some clicking on my
laptop. If my last post was the climax of my book writing adventure, consider
this the denouement. You&rsquo;ve been with me this long, it&rsquo;s the least I can do.</p>

<p>I do hold back one detail, though: while I talk about sales here, I won&rsquo;t be
putting cash numbers on it. If you try hard enough, you can calculate them
yourself, but I feel weird sharing financial details. Strangely, it&rsquo;s not
because I&rsquo;m shy about <em>strangers</em> knowing it as much as I am friends and family.
So much room for awkwardness there.</p>

<h2>I am a marketer and I do marketer-y things</h2>

<p>As I mentioned before, I decided to self-publish about halfway through writing
the manuscript. That meant I had to wear all of the hats that a publisher has
dedicated noggins for: editor, designer, proofreader, and&hellip; marketer. This last
one is the least fun for me, but I know it&rsquo;s important.</p>

<p>I read a bit online and what a lot of people said was that email lists are gold.
<em>I</em> like that they are pull-based instead of push-based. Instead of jamming
myself and my book down strangers&rsquo; throats, they sign up of their own volition.
I only get in touch with the people who actually want to hear from me.</p>

<p>So I created a <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a> account&mdash;chosen over other mailing list providers
mainly because of their cute logo&mdash;and slapped a little &ldquo;sign up!&rdquo; form on
every page of the site. Whenever I put a new chapter online, I got a traffic
bump and some fraction of those people were kind or foolhardy enough to grant me
their email address.</p>

<p>I did this pretty early in the writing process so that I could give it time to
grow before the book was complete. By putting the whole book online and
releasing it chapterly (like a Dickens serial for the Internet age) I had
amassed a surprisingly large list by the time I was ready to <strike>try to
squeeze money out of them</strike> tell them my book was complete. Around 8,000
people, which still seems like a crazy large number to me.</p>

<p>I also, despite <a href="https://twitter.com/munificentbob">the content of my tweets</a>, managed to acquire a fair
number of twitter friends. (I don&rsquo;t like thinking of them &ldquo;followers&rdquo;.
Celebutants and TEDx thought/cult leaders have &ldquo;followers&rdquo;. I just have Internet
pals.)</p>

<h2>A new front page</h2>

<p>Now that the book is a <em>product</em> as much as it is a <em>web site</em>, I redid the
front page to highlight both of those. It still, of course, links to the web
version. And, <em>of course</em>, the entire contents of the book are still readable on
the web. But I also added links to the various sites where you could get the
print version, Kindle, and EPUB.</p>

<p>I wanted to emphasize the &ldquo;bookyness&rdquo; of it, the physicality, so I got out my
camera and my macro lens and took a bunch of honest-to-God photos of it:</p>

<figure>
<img class="framed" src="/image/2014/11/cover-shoot.jpg">
<figcaption>Wait... if the camera is in the photo, how did I take
<em>this</em> shot?</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There&rsquo;s something weird and meta about taking a picture of myself taking photos
of a book whose cover I designed using a photo I took of an illustration I drew.
I should take a picture of myself writing this blog post just to go full
Inception.</p>

<p>Next, I spent way too long coming up with a design and text for the front page.
Seriously, it took me as long to make what is effectively a glorified list of
hyperlinks as it did to write, illustrate, and edit a full chapter of the book.
I think it&rsquo;s worth it, though. The front page is the reader&rsquo;s first impression
of the book. If I make you feel that page is beautiful and high quality, it&rsquo;s a
short hop to having faith that the inside of the book is too.</p>

<p>I ended up with this:</p>

<h2>This part of the blog post is about writing a blog post</h2>

<p>I feel a little squirmy writing this. Like I said, I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with
self-promotion. I hoped, wanted, to get a decent amount of&hellip; attention?
traffic? validation of my worth as a human? when I announced the for-sale
versions of the book. Readers had been asking for them for a while, so I knew
there would be some excitement just by saying, &ldquo;Here they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But that didn&rsquo;t feel really newsworthy to me. There wasn&rsquo;t much to discuss, just
&ldquo;here they are. moneys plz.&rdquo; People like a story, and I like telling them,
especially when the protagonist is yours truly. I&rsquo;ve been really lucky to have a
lot of encouragement on this project from readers, and I thought one way to say
thanks would be to give a window into what the production process was like. It&rsquo;s
a side of book-making that I don&rsquo;t see very much online.</p>

<p>Also, it let me blather about fonts for six thousand words. Seriously, the <a href="/2014/11/03/bringing-my-web-book-to-print-and-ebook/">blog
post</a> I wrote about turning the manuscript into a physical book is longer than
almost every chapter in the book. Clearly, I need an editor.</p>

<p>This also took a lot of time&mdash;about a week&mdash;but I really enjoyed writing it
all down. I did my best to make it an entertaining read. While I hoped it would
drive traffic to the book, I did honestly want it to be a worthwhile read in and
of itself. I believe that, when played well, life is a non-zero-sum game.</p>

<h2>I &lt;3 filling out web forms</h2>

<p>I was ready to upload the new site, and the new blog post. All that was left was
to actually make the book available. This involved uploading various files&mdash;inside PDF for the print version, cover, EPUB file, MOBI file&mdash;to various
sites whose forms cover the full gamut of usability. Clicking the final &ldquo;OK&rdquo; on
CreateSpace, Kindle Direct Publishing, and Smashwords was both nerve-wracking
and anti-climactic.</p>

<p>Then the waiting game. Most of these sites do various amounts of automated and
manual validation that take time to process. I noticed a typo that forced me to
re-upload to CreateSpace. Kindle found a couple of spelling errors (surprising
given how many rounds of editing I&rsquo;d done by now). Smashwords asked me to have
an explicit cover page.</p>

<p>Once those were all happy, the listings appeared. If you knew to look for them,
you could have bought the book.</p>

<p>CreateSpace and Smashwords also distribute to other sales channels (things like
Lightning Source and book stores for the former; iBooks, Nook, Kobo, etc. for
the latter). I wanted to wait for those sales channels to populate before I
pulled the switch but&hellip; well, I got impatient.</p>

<p>As soon as I saw <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0990582906">the Amazon page for my book</a>, I just couldn&rsquo;t wait any
more. I pushed the new version of the site and the blog post. I wrote an email
and blasted the mailing list. I tweeted. I mentioned it on G+.</p>

<p>What I <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> do this time was post it to Reddit. It felt a little too
self-serving for how Reddit rolls. I did post a link to the blog <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8555285">on Hacker
News</a> since that crowd is more accepting of self-promotion.</p>

<p>I had tabs open for the Smashwords sales dashboard, CreateSpace royalties,
Kindle Direct Publishing sales report, Twitter, and Hacker News. I refreshed
those suckers like my life depended on it.</p>

<h2>Command, we are ready for launch</h2>

<p>This moment, as dumb as it sounds, was actually pretty stressful. A surprisingly
large number of self-published books just sink to the depths leaving nary a
ripple on the surface. You hear horror stories of writers whose novels sell
<em>zero</em> copies. Nonfiction is a lot easier, but I still had no idea if people
really liked the book enough to drop real cash on it.</p>

<p><em>Refresh refresh refresh refresh.</em> A nervous sweat trickled down my neck.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Smashwords reported two sales. Holy shit! Someone bought
the book! I was a professional writer!</p>

<p>Then people started retweeting me. Someone posted a blurb about it <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2l9hr0/game_programming_patterns_is_now_in_print/">on the gamedev subreddit</a> and someone else did <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2l8v11/today_is_the_day_game_programming_patterns_now_in/">on the programming subreddit</a>.</p>

<p>People started saying super nice things! About me! It was awesome! Also, I was
drinking in celebration at the same time so that multiplied all the good
feelings.</p>

<figure>
<img class="framed" src="/image/2014/11/cat.gif">
<figcaption>How I felt.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I feverishly replied to as many comments, tweets, and emails as I could. (All
the while still refreshing the other tabs.) Eventually, I maxed out my serotonin
levels and had to crash. Like some candy raver in an E puddle in the back of the
chill-out room, I passed out, totally spent.</p>

<h2>The next day</h2>

<p>I woke up the next morning feeling like a kid on Christmas. A kid who wasn&rsquo;t
<em>entirely</em> certain he&rsquo;d been good enough for Santa to bring him presents.
Morning coffee in hand, I opened up my laptop and checked all the dashboards.</p>

<p>While I slept, I&rsquo;d sold enough copies to pay off all of the expenses of the
book. That isn&rsquo;t actually <em>that</em> much: all I&rsquo;d paid for was ISBN numbers, a
couple of fonts, freelance copy-editing, and a business license. But, still, I
was in the black now.</p>

<p>I replied to as many people as I could and then headed into the office to
<strike>get some work done</strike> spend the rest of the day refreshing my
browser. Aggregate sales stats started showing up in the various dashboards:</p>

<figure>
<img class="framed" src="/image/2014/11/kindle-hockey.png">
<figcaption>Kindle sales on the first day.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img class="framed" src="/image/2014/11/smash-hockey.png">
  <figcaption>Smashwords (EPUB) sales on the first day.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>CreateSpace doesn&rsquo;t draw a pretty picture for you, but the raw numbers were
doing the same thing. I told my coworkers and they got all excited for me.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was basically a blur of responding to people and telling my
wife and team how high the numbers were going. At some point, when I refreshed
the Amazon page, I noticed a little banner had appeared next to my book:</p>

<figure>
<img class="framed" src="/image/2014/11/banner.png">
<figcaption>No way.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It turns out Amazon tracks book sales <em>very quickly.</em> For the brief period of
time where I had saturated social media, enough sales were coming in to actually
make it the best-selling game programming book for a little while.</p>

<figure>
<img class="framed" src="/image/2014/11/best-game.png">
<figcaption>Sorry "Learning Python".</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Wait, did I say &ldquo;game programming&rdquo;? I meant #1 out of <em>all programming books</em>:</p>

<figure>
<img class="framed" src="/image/2014/11/best-programming.png">
<figcaption>I did a victory lap at this point.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At it&rsquo;s peak, my book was the #7 best-selling book in the entire computer
category:</p>

<figure>
<img class="framed" src="/image/2014/11/best-computer.png">
<figcaption>Up there with Minecraft!</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Around this time, I started referring to myself in the third person as
&ldquo;best-selling author Robert Nystrom&rdquo;. Of course, most of the other books in
those lists had been there for weeks or months, but I had my moment in the sun
and I was committed to making the most of it.</p>

<h2>Return to normalcy</h2>

<p>The peak, naturally, only lasted about a day. I was most curious to see what the
right side of the graph would look like. Would it fall to zero? A slow trickle?
A steady passive income?</p>

<p>When I sent out the email for the book, one thing I asked was for people to
write honest, detailed reviews. I figured a book page with a good set of reviews
would give it the air of legimitacy for future customers who stumbled onto the
book on their own. That in turn would help the book have a longer sales tail.</p>

<p>Because people are awesome and I love every one of them, people did indeed do
this. It took a while, but reviews started trickling in.</p>

<p>Other pleasant surprises started happening too. The book finally made its way
through the other channels. I put it up on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Robert_Nystrom_Game_Programming_Patterns?id=9fIwBQAAQBAJ">Google Play</a>, and Smashwords got
it onto <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9780990582915">iBooks</a>, <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/game-programming-patterns-robert-nystrom/1102794265?ean=2940046391428">Nook</a>, and some other places. I finally figured out a
place to <a href="https://payhip.com/b/iZRI">sell the PDF</a>. (If you go to <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/">the book&rsquo;s site</a> now, these are
all listed there.)</p>

<p>In a mistake that I don&rsquo;t understand but can&rsquo;t bear to correct, Apple even
decided to spice up my name a bit:</p>

<figure>
<img class="framed" src="/image/2014/11/umlaut.png">
<figcaption>Robert Nyström, now 15% more metal.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Then, a few days later, the most magical part of this whole thing started
happening (though, honestly, the umlaut is a close second). That&rsquo;s about how
long it took for print copies to get shipped to people.</p>

<p>Soon, friends and family&mdash;some who I haven&rsquo;t seen in years&mdash;started sending
me pictures of their copies of the book. Kind strangers in countries I couldn&rsquo;t
find on a map tweeted pictures of themselves opening the shipping box with
excitement to see my dumb face staring out at them.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to articulate how profoundly gratifying that is. Through almost the
entire six years I&rsquo;ve been working on this book, it&rsquo;s been a purely digital
thing. While I spend an astonishing amount of my life on the Internet, it still
never quite feels &ldquo;real&rdquo; to me.</p>

<p>Is rearranging some polarization on an SSD really <em>making</em> something? Is a few
words glowing on an LCD actually communicating with a <em>person</em>, or just some
pixelated avatar?</p>

<p>But seeing photos of real live people holding an actual <em>physical thing</em> filled
with words and illustrations I put together, and seeing them <em>happy</em> to have it
in their hands finally made it click for me that I made something real that
actually affected people.</p>

<h2>How we&rsquo;re looking now</h2>

<p>Things have mostly settled down since then, though I do still have lots of email
to catch up on (sorry!). Now that the book is in pretty much every sales
channel, e-book walled garden, and international site for Amazon, I&rsquo;m <em>finally</em>
getting to the point where I can think of the book as <em>done</em> and put it into the
background of my life.</p>

<p>So far, buyers have been trickling in at a decent rate. Here&rsquo;s what my Kindle
sales look like as of writing this post:</p>

<figure>
<img class="framed" src="/image/2014/11/kindle-now.png">
<figcaption>EPUB is similar, and I think print is too.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The book has been out about two weeks, and I&rsquo;ve sold:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>796 print copies.</strong> 555 in the US, 145 in Great Britain, 95 in Europe, and
1 directly from createspace.com.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>274 Kindle copies.</strong> I&rsquo;ll spare you the per country break-down, but it is
really cool to see that I&rsquo;ve sold it in India, Japan, Brazil, and other
places.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>70 copies from smashwords.</strong> This is people who wany to buy the EPUB file
directly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>7 copies from iBooks.</strong> The book only appeared a few days ago, so I expect
this to catch up with the other channels over time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s a grand total of <strong>1,147 copies sold in the first two weeks.</strong> I won&rsquo;t be
retiring off of this, but I&rsquo;m really really happy with that number, and
unbelievably grateful to everyone who bought a copy.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m planning to take a good long break from serious projects first, this
level of success has certainly gotten me pumped about writing another book. If I
do, I&rsquo;m 100% confident now in my approach of putting the entire book online for
free. I&rsquo;m certain I wouldn&rsquo;t have sold anywhere near this many copies if the
book&rsquo;s website hadn&rsquo;t built an audience who were ready and eager to get their
hands on a copy.</p>

<p>It turns out giving something away is a great way to get something back.</p>
