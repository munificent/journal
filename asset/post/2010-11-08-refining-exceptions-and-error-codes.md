I've been thinking a lot about error-handling in [Magpie][], and I wanted to
foist a couple of ideas out there to get some feedback.

[magpie]: https://magpie-lang.org/

## Kinds of errors

When I'm designing something, I tend to start from a few representative
examples, and then I see how my idea for a solution handles those cases.
Error-handling encompasses a pretty wide range of cases, everything from "you
typed the name wrong" to "the machine is on fire". That space is pretty big, but
I think the following touch the most important corners of it. Let me know if I
missed something:

### Programmatic errors: the programmer screwed up

When I look at code I wrote, most of the error-handling code in it is for
handling errors in *other* code. In other words, it's code contract stuff:
validation code that asserts what arguments should look like and what state
objects should be in when you try to do stuff with them.

When possible, it's good to squash those bugs *statically* so you don't need
code to handle them at all. Magpie does that with `null` reference bugs, but
there are others that are trickier -- things like out of bounds array access, or
attempting to cast a variable to the wrong type.

In C and C++, these errors are usually handled using `assert()` or similar
mechanisms. Java and C# each have a set of standard exception types that are
thrown: `InvalidOperationException`, `IllegalArgumentException`, etc.

Checks for these errors are very common, so they should be lightweight in both
in code and in CPU cycles. At the same time, we don't generally *handle* these
errors, in the sense of recovering at runtime. Instead, we just want to *notice*
the error and scream and shout to the programmer to handle it by fixing the code
that causes the error in the first place. Giving diagnostic information like a
stack trace is good.

### Runtime errors: the real world isn't perfect

I lump into this fuzzy category errors that can occur at runtime and either
can't be programmatically prevented, or where detecting the error beforehand is
as expensive as performing the operation itself and seeing if it failed. Some
examples:

1.  Working with files or the network.

2.  Parsing, formatting, or manipulating data.

These are the kinds of things we typically think of when we think of "errors".
We want to notice when they've happened, and we will very likely need to write
code to try to recover from them gracefully at runtime.

What this category *doesn't* imply is any sort of *frequency*. Whether or not a
given error is common is entirely dependent on the application. A blog engine
probably considers text parsing a common source of errors. A game app that just
loads a single config file with a known format can safely assume that won't
happen.

In other words, the code *producing* the error doesn't determine its severity.
It's the code *handling* the error that has enough context to know how common
and how critical the failure is. This means we want to have some flexibility
regarding how errors in this category are handled. If we force a certain
strategy by assuming that some errors are common and some are rare, then we'll
shaft users that aren't like us.

### Catastrophic errors (all hell breaks loose)

The last category is errors that are so deep that we probably *can't* handle
them. These are errors are distinguished by the fact that they interfere with
our ability to execute further code -- things like stack overflows or running
out of memory.

## Handling errors

There are a [bunch of different strategies][strategies] languages have tried
over the years to cope with the inevitable fallibility of mankind. The two I'm
most interested for Magpie are return codes (using [unions][]) and exceptions.
Those seem to be the workhorses for languages in wide use. (I'm interested in
other ideas, but for this post, I just want to look at those two.)

[strategies]: http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3896#comment-58374
[unions]: /2010/08/23/void-null-maybe-and-nothing/

Now, the question is how can we use those two features to deal with the different
categories of errors I listed up there?

### Handling programmatic errors

These are probably the easiest to solve (from the language design perspective)
because there's little to do: we don't plan to handle them in most cases, just
notice them. I'm comfortable with the Java and C# model of "throw an exception
that isn't expected to be caught". Aborting with a stack dump is equally
effective, and does the same thing in practice.

For example, a method for accessing an item in a collection could look like:

```magpie
def Collection getItemAt(index Int -> Item)
  if index < 0 or index > count then OutOfBoundsError throw()

  // Do stuff with index...
end
```

That is a bit tedious, though. I'd likely refactor that into a separate
function, like:

```magpie
def Int checkBounds(count Int ->)
  if this < 0 or this > count then OutOfBoundsError throw()
end

def Collection getItemAt(index Int -> Item)
  index checkBounds(count)

  // Do stuff with index...
end
```

Not exactly rocket science, but I think it gets the job done. Let's skip runtime
errors and move on to the other easy one:

### Handling catastrophic errors

Catastrophic errors are exceptional in the sense that we'll rarely be handling
them, so exceptions are a good fit here too. In fact, most of these exceptions
wouldn't even be thrown from Magpie code -- they'd bubble up from the bowels of
the interpreter itself.

On the off chance that you *do* want to catch one, you can use a regular catch
block:

```magpie
try
  // Allocate a huge array...
catch (err OutOfMemoryError)
  // Handle the error...
end
```

Familiar territory. If you've used exceptions a lot, you've noticed one annoying
thing with them is that they're syntactically cumbersome. You have to create
this `try` block and push everything over a level of indentation. To try to
simplify that, I'm batting around an idea that might be clever, or might just be
really dumb: treat *every* block as a `try` block.

The basic idea is that any block can have `catch` clauses at the end of it, and
having them implicitly makes it a `try` block. That should take code like this:

```magpie
def copy(source String, dest String ->)
  try
    // Copy files...
  catch (e IOError)
    // Handle error...
  end
end
```

And simplify it to:

```magpie
def copy(source String, dest String ->)
  // Copy files...
catch (e IOError)
  // Handle error...
end
```

I'll have to try it out to see if it causes any problems in the grammar, but my
hope is it will work OK. I'm curious to see if just making exceptions a little
more terse like this will make them more palatable to people who dislike them.
If you happen to have an opinion, I'd like to hear it.

### Handling runtime errors

Finally, the biggest class of errors. The trick with these is that there's no
easy way to bucket them into "common" and "rare". If we could, we could just say
"use exceptions for the rare ones and return codes for the common ones".
Instead, we need to support both.

Here's my plan. For our example, we'll consider a simple one: parsing. Let's say
we have a function to parse strings to Booleans:

```magpie
def parseBool(text String -> Bool)
  match text
  case "true" then true
  case "false" then false
  else // ??? What do we do here?
  end
end
```

This can be called like so:

```magpie
var b = parseBool("true")
```

Of course, the question is what happens if parsing fails? Since failure may be
common, we want it to be easy to handle the error case. Unions are a good fit
for that. We'll change the function to this:

```magpie
def parseBool(text String -> Bool | Nothing)
    match text
    case "true" then true
    case "false" then false
    else nothing
    end
end
```

Now it will return a Boolean value if the parse succeeds, or the special
[`nothing`][nothing] value if it fails. Note that this is *not* like just
returning `null` -- the return type of `parseBool` is different now. That means
you can't do this anymore:

[nothing]: http://localhost:8000/2010/08/23/void-null-maybe-and-nothing/

```magpie
var b = parseBool("true")
var notB = b not
```

The `not` method is a method on Booleans, and `b` isn't a Boolean, it's a `Bool
| Nothing`. To treat it like a Boolean, you first have to check its type. The
canonical way to do that in Magpie is using `let`:

```magpie
let b = parseBool("true")
  // In here, b is a Bool.
  var notB = b not // This is fine
else
  // Parse failed...
end
```

This is great for cases where parsing is likely to fail. It makes sure you
always handle the common failure case by giving you a type check error before
the program is run if you don't check for success first.

But what if parsing rarely fails in your program? Do you really want to have to
do a cumbersome `let` block everywhere you call `parseBool` just because that
fails all the time in some other program? In your case, failing to parse *is*
exceptional, so it should throw an exception. That way, you can ignore the cases
that aren't relevant to your problem. I think we can handle that too.

We'll just add a simple method to `Object` that tests to see if its of an
expected type. If not, it throws, otherwise it returns itself, but statically
typed to the expected type. Like so:

```magpie
def Object expecting[T]
  let cast = this as[T] then
    cast
  else UnexpectedTypeError throw(
      "Expected type " + T + " but was " + this type, this)
end
```

Now, if we have a function that returns a union containing an error, we can
translate that to an exception instead like this:

```magpie
// Doesn't expect a parse error.
var b = parseBool("true") expecting[Bool]
var notB = b not // OK, since b is a Bool.
```

Using this, almost all functions that can have runtime errors are implemented by
returning a union of success and an error code, like:

```magpie
def readFile(path String -> String | IOError)
  if pathExists(path) then
    // Return contents of file...
  else IOError new("Could not find " + path)
end
```

Then code that uses it can handle the error in place if that makes sense:

```magpie
def printFile(path String ->)
    var result = readFile(path)
    let contents = result as[String] then
        print(contents)
    else let error = result as[IOError] then
        print("Error!")
    end
end
```

(Yes, `else let` is a bit tedious. Better pattern-matching syntax for unions is
still in the works.) Meanwhile, code that doesn't care to handle the error right
there can pass the buck:

```magpie
def printFile(path String ->)
    var contents = readFile(path) expecting[String]
    print(contents)
end
```

Of course, none of this is any real innovation. My goal here is just to round
off some of the sharp corners of exceptions and return codes and see if I can
make the process of dealing with errors a bit more flexible and readable.
Thoughts?
