<p>By all rights, I should love <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>. I like low-level languages. I&rsquo;m comfortable
in C and have written memory managers for fun. I hate the boilerplate of Java
and the compile times of C++. I like closures and garbage collection. I think
locks and semaphores aren&rsquo;t the right way to do concurrency, and I really dig
<a href="/2010/07/13/fibers-coroutines-in-finch/">coroutines</a>.</p>

<p>Despite all of that, though, I&rsquo;ve failed to warm to the language. I thought it
might be useful (for me at least) to try to clarify why Go isn&rsquo;t the language I
wish it was. The most constructive way I could think of to do that is to
describe that hypothetical future Go and why I think it would be an improvement.</p>

<p>Much of this is based on my understanding of what Go is today. If I get stuff
wrong, let me know.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: This post ended up way longer than I expected. Super science summary: I
wish Go had tuples, unions, constructors, no Nil, exceptions, generics, some
syntax sugar, and ponies that shoot Cheez Whiz out of their noses.</strong></p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>Go&rsquo;s current syntax is a streamlined version of C, sort of like Danny DeVito
with elevator shoes. Let&rsquo;s aim a little higher. Smalltalk, Python, and Ruby have
all given us a slew of good ideas we can learn from to make a language more
expressive and readable. Here&rsquo;s a few I&rsquo;d really like:</p>

<h3>Named/keyword arguments</h3>

<p>Positional arguments are great for terseness, and when a function takes
arguments of different types, errors with them are rare. However, once a
function starts taking more than two or three arguments or takes arguments of
the same type, errors become common. Quick, does <code>substring</code> take a length or an
ending index? Does <code>find</code> take <code>needle, haystack</code> or <code>haystack, needle</code>?</p>

<p>Named or keyword arguments solve that. Smalltalk uses them for <em>all</em>
multi-argument methods, but I think that&rsquo;s going a bit too far. One simple bit
of syntactic sugar would be to allow a function call like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="i">substring</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">from</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="i">start</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="i">to</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="i">end</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>To be translated by the parser into:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="i">substring__from__to</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">start</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="i">end</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This would also give you a primitive form of overloading:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="i">substring</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">from</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="i">start</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="i">to</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="i">end</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="i">substring</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">from</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="i">start</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="i">length</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="i">end</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="i">substring</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">from</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="i">start</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>These function calls would all desugar to distinct long function names, so even
though they&rsquo;re all <code>substring</code>, there&rsquo;s no overloading or name collision.
Overloading like this also covers default arguments: simply provide an overload
with some keywords missing that then forwards to the longer version, passing in
the missing argument.</p>

<h3>Block arguments</h3>

<p>A lot of behavior comes in pairs: you open a file, then close it. You start a
transaction, then commit it. You lock, then unlock. In between the pairs, a
chunk of code is performed. This can be done manually, like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="i">file</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="i">os</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="i">Open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">filename</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="i">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="i">println</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">file</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="i">Read</span><span class="p">())</span>
<span class="i">file</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="i">Close</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>But then you have to ensure you don&rsquo;t forget to close it. Go&rsquo;s <code>defer</code> gives you
a little help here, but you still have to <em>remember</em> to <code>defer</code> each call. In
C++, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization">RAII</a> is the solution, but I&rsquo;m particularly fond of how <a href="https://www.rubyguides.com/2016/02/ruby-procs-and-lambdas/">Ruby</a>
solves this. We can solve the &ldquo;forgetting to close&rdquo; problem in Go today by
defining a function like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="k">func</span> <span class="i">ReadFile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">filename</span> <span class="t">string</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="i">block</span> <span class="k">func</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">f</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="t">File</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="i">file</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="i">os</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="i">Open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">filename</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="i">block</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">file</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="i">file</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="i">Close</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now when you need to read from a file, you just do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="i">ReadFile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">filename</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">func</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">file</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="i">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="i">println</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">file</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="i">Read</span><span class="p">())</span>
<span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re safely guaranteed to close the file when the operation is done. This
works because Go has lexical closures, a really nice feature. But the syntax for
this is ungainly. Ruby addresses this with block arguments. Translated to Go,
they could look something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="i">ReadFile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">filename</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">file</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="i">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="i">println</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">file</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="i">Read</span><span class="p">())</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The block after <code>do</code> would be wrapped in a closure and passed to the preceding
function as a subsequent argument. (In other words, it desugars to exactly the
previous example.) This would, I think, give you a really simple basis for
defining scoped behavior without having to go down the route of destructors or
more complicated context management like Python&rsquo;s <code>with</code>.</p>

<h3>Operator overloading</h3>

<p>I understand this is a religious issue for some people. Apparently, there is a
cadre of truly evil programmers out there overloading operators to do malicious
subversive things and good-hearted God-fearing coders are getting harmed by this
every day.</p>

<p>Somehow I&rsquo;ve dodged that bullet. The cases where I&rsquo;ve seen operator overloading
used have been easy to understand and valid: vectors, matrices, complex numbers,
arbitrary-precision numbers. Those, to me, sound like the exact kind of data
structures a systems language like Go would use frequently. Being able to define
operators that do what you expect on them would be nice. Call me crazy, but I
prefer:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="i">position</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="i">origin</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="i">offset</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="i">orientation</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="i">speed</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>over:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="i">position</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="i">Add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">Add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">origin</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="i">offset</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="i">Multiply</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">orientation</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="i">speed</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>The type system</h2>

<p>Go has two really neat type system features: implicitly implemented interfaces
and a flat type hierarchy. There are two other simple additions I&rsquo;d dig: tuples
and unions.</p>

<h3>Tuples</h3>

<p>Go already has multiple returns, so the utility of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple">tuples</a>&mdash;ad-hoc data
structures for bundling a couple of values together&mdash;is clearly appreciated.
Making tuples a first-class part of the type system would make multiple returns
feel less special and eliminate some corner cases of the language.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of what I&rsquo;m talking about: Let&rsquo;s say you have some generator
function that&rsquo;s returning values. You take those returns and put them in a
container (which just stores them as <code>interface{}</code>). Later, you pull those out.</p>

<p>As it currently stands, that only works with generators that have a single
return. If tuples were first class, that would allow multiple returning
functions without any problems. With generics, this becomes an even more
useful property: generic functions can work with single or multiple arguments
without needing <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.func-17?view=net-5.0">a slew of overloads for arity</a>.</p>

<p>In other words, instead of <code>,</code> being a special <em>syntactic</em> feature of certain
statement types (<code>return</code>, <code>var</code>, and <code>:=</code>), it would become an <em>expression</em>
that creates composite values.</p>

<p>The syntax would be simple: a comma creates a tuple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="i">point</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">2</span>          <span class="c">// Create a tuple of two ints.</span>
<span class="i">doSomething</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">true</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;s&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c">// Pass a tuple to a function.</span>
<span class="k">return</span> <span class="i">value</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="i">err</span>      <span class="c">// Return a tuple.</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Multiple assignment could be used to pull fields out of a tuple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="i">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="i">y</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="i">point</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Unions</h3>

<p>Unions are the other compound type made famous by the ML family of languages.
Where a tuple says &ldquo;this value is an X <em>and</em> a Y&rdquo;, a union says, &ldquo;this value is
an X <em>or</em> a Y&rdquo;. They&rsquo;re useful anywhere you want to have a value that&rsquo;s one of a
few different possible types.</p>

<p>One use case that would fit well in Go is error codes. Many functions in Go
return a value on success or an error code on failure using a multiple return.
The problem there is that if there is an error, the other value that gets
returned is bogus. Using a union would let you explicitly declare that the
function returns a value <em>or</em> an error but not both.</p>

<p>In return, the caller specifically has to check which case was returned before
they can use the value. This ensures that errors cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>There are two flavors of unions in other languages. Ad-hoc unions as used in
<a href="http://pike.ida.liu.se/generated/manual/ref/chapter_3.html#4">Pike</a>, <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-guide/types.html#%28part._.Union_.Types%29">Typed Scheme</a>, and the <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/?csw=1">Closure Javascript Compiler</a> don&rsquo;t
attach labels to each case. The more familiar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_type">sum types</a> of ML, Haskell, and
F# do. Both have their advantages. I think tagged unions are less useful in Go
since interfaces cover some of that use case.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of what ad-hoc unions could look like in Go. Let&rsquo;s say we want
to write a function that parses strings into numbers. It returns an <code>int</code> on
success, but may also fail. Using a union, you could define that like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="k">func</span> <span class="i">ParseInt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">text</span> <span class="t">string</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="t">int</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="t">Error</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c">// Code to parse...</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="i">success</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="i">value</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="i">ParseError</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Could not parse string.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note the <code>|</code> in the return type declaration and that the two <code>return</code> statements
return different types. A caller would then determine if it was successful using
a type test. The syntax could be improved, but something not too far from what
Go has now could look like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="i">parsed</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="i">ParseInt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;123&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">switch</span> <span class="i">parsed</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="k">case</span> <span class="t">int</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="i">i</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="c">// Here, i is the parsed int value.</span>
<span class="k">case</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="t">Error</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="i">err</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="c">// Here, err is the error.</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is more type-safe that it may at first appear. It&rsquo;s important to note that
the type of <code>parsed</code> is <em>not</em> <code>int</code>, it&rsquo;s <code>int | *Error</code>. That means that trying
to ignore the error and treat the value returned from <code>ParseInt</code> like a number
by doing something like <code>parsed + 1</code> will be a <em>compile</em> error. This lets us
statically ensure that errors are not ignored, which I think meshes nicely with
Go&rsquo;s &ldquo;explicit is better&rdquo; philosophy.</p>

<p>The other thing I like about this is that we&rsquo;ve avoided returning some
meaningless int value on failure. If there is an error, there won&rsquo;t be an <code>int</code>
value at all, and we won&rsquo;t create a variable for it.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s marginally useful for numbers, but for functions that may return a
complex initialized object or an error, it&rsquo;s nice not having to build some
zombie zero-initialized struct that shouldn&rsquo;t be used anyway. This is a good
segue into the next section&hellip;</p>

<h2>Initialization</h2>

<p>A big part of the appeal of static languages is that they can help us avoid
errors. One common source of errors is improperly initialized values.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s two species of initialization bugs that get lumped together. The first
is <em>completely</em> uninitialized values: a value is yanked out of the primordial
byte soup without setting a single bit. You have no idea what state it&rsquo;s in.
These bugs exist in C, to a lesser extent C++, and not at all in almost all
other languages.</p>

<p>The other species more common today is a value that&rsquo;s initialized to a
well-defined but useless state. This includes things like member variables that
are <code>null</code> but shouldn&rsquo;t be in Java, causing NullPointerExceptions later,
strings that shouldn&rsquo;t be empty, etc. Anything where an object&rsquo;s state doesn&rsquo;t
meet the invariants that it requires to function properly.</p>

<p>Go, designed to be an improvement on C, eradicates the first species but not the
second. I&rsquo;d like to go further than that. One of the things I love about static
languages is their ability to ensure at compile time that certain kinds of
errors are not present. Initialization bugs are a big class of errors we can
fix. There are a couple of ideas we can learn from other languages to help here.</p>

<h3>Constructors</h3>

<p>Constructors are the obvious one. If you want to ensure your objects are in some
known state, having a function that puts it in that state is a good way to go
about it. Of course, you can write initialization functions in any language,
including C, but the clever part about constructors is that a new object <em>must</em>
go through one. Constructors are the gatekeeper for an object&rsquo;s state.</p>

<p>Any C++ user can tell you that constructors are fairly complex, but the success
of C++, Java, and C# also tells us that it isn&rsquo;t intractably so. A minimal
proposal for constructors is something like this:</p>

<p>A function declared in the same package as a type with the same name as the type
defines a constructor function. Structs can be created by value by calling the
function directly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="i">pt</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="i">Point</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">3</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or they can be created by on the heap using <code>new</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="i">pt</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="i">Point</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">3</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>If a struct has no constructors, it implicitly gets a default one. If it has one
or more constructor functions, then any creation must go through one of those.</p>

<p>A constructor&rsquo;s primary responsibility is to initialize all of the fields of the
struct. It is a static error to access a field in a constructor before it&rsquo;s been
assigned, and also a static error to fail to assign to all fields by the end of
the method body.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s obviously a pretty rough proposal but it&rsquo;s in the shape of something
that I think would help make for safer code.</p>

<h3>Eliminating nil</h3>

<p>Once you have constructors and you can statically ensure that every variable has
a chance at initialization, you can start to escape one of the <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3186">most unfortunate
language misfeatures</a> in wide use today: <code>null</code>. Following in the
footsteps of C++ and others, Go allows any pointer or reference to refer to a
value or to also potentially be <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>If your function expects a <code>*Foo</code>, you may get a pointer to a Foo, or you may
get <code>nil</code>. It&rsquo;s up to you to check for it at runtime, everywhere, all the time.
Fail to do so, and you run the risk of your program crashing on a null pointer.</p>

<p>Languages in the ML family don&rsquo;t have this problem. There, if a function takes a
Foo, you will always get a Foo, no matter what. The bit of special sauce to
enable that is that you must ensure that all variables are initialized. That
way, you can&rsquo;t create a variable of type <code>*Foo</code> without actually initializing it
with a pointer to a Foo.</p>

<p>If we add constructors, we&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to do that initialization,
and an entire class of painfully common bugs disappears.</p>

<h2>Error-handling</h2>

<p>Go has two strategies for error-handling: return codes and <code>panic</code>. I like
returning error codes for cases where errors can be expected to happen
frequently in the course of normal execution&mdash;things like parsing strings or
looking up items in a collection.</p>

<p>For most other operations, I&rsquo;ve found exceptions to be more manageable than
error codes. Automatically unwinding the stack until you reach code that&rsquo;s ready
to handle the error is just the kind of deeply brilliant behavior that I think
is a good fit for Go&rsquo;s philosophy of a small number of open-ended features.</p>

<p>While they may not realize it, I think the Go designers actually agree with me.
Consider this code from <a href="https://go.dev/blog/defer-panic-and-recover">the article linked to</a> on <a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq#exceptions">why Go doesn&rsquo;t have
exceptions</a>:</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Those two <code>if err != nil</code> blocks are exactly what exceptions do for you,
automatically and gracefully. Another example: every place I could find in the
<a href="http://golang.org/src/pkg/json/decode.go">JSON decoder</a> that looks at an error code immediately unwinds the stack
by returning an error code in turn or panicking.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of heated debates between Go fans and haters about how
exceptions are the best or worst thing ever, but scant actual elucidation as to
<em>why</em>. For what it&rsquo;s worth, here&rsquo;s my take. In addition to the aforementioned
automatic stack-unwinding, there&rsquo;s two other things I like about exceptions:</p>

<h3>No zombie variables</h3>

<p>My favorite aspect of exceptions is that they can, just by the shape of the
code, prevent you from doing something incorrect. Consider this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="k">try</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="t">File</span> <span class="i">file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="i">openFile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">filename</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="i">file</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="i">read</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">catch</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="t">RuntimeException</span> <span class="i">ex</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="t">System</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="i">out</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="i">println</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Oh noes!&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>What exceptions give you here is the absolute guarantee that <code>file</code> will <em>never</em>
hold anything except the value of a <em>successful</em> return from <code>openFile</code>. You
don&rsquo;t have to check an error code. You don&rsquo;t have to check if it&rsquo;s <code>null</code>. If
you make it to the <code>file.read()</code>, you know you have a valid file. In other
words, we get to use blocks to limit the scope of variables to only exist when
it&rsquo;s <em>correct</em> for them to do so.</p>

<h3>Type safety without coupling</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s another nice feature of exceptions, but it&rsquo;s a bit elaborate to explain.
Let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m passing an object of a type I defined to some third-party library,
which then calls a method on the object. So the callstack looks something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>1: MyObject::doSomething()
2: ThirdPartyLib::callMyObject()
3: MyCode::passObjectToLib()
4: main()
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s say that <code>doSomething()</code> method fails and throws an exception of type
<code>MyException</code>, which I catch in <code>passObjectToLib()</code>. The third-party library has
<em>no awareness of that type at all</em>. What&rsquo;s cool about exceptions is that this
works just fine: I can catch my own exception type with complete type safety
even though it unwinds the callstack <em>through</em> a layer that&rsquo;s completely
oblivious to that type.</p>

<p>If you try to do the same thing with error codes where <code>callMyObject()</code> manually
takes the error returned by <code>doSomething()</code> and returns it back to
<code>passObjectToLib()</code>, then the third party library has to store that error in
some <code>interface{}</code>-like untyped variable since it doesn&rsquo;t know the actual type.
When the error is handed back to <code>passObjectToLib()</code>, the receiving code has to
do a dynamic cast. In other words, we have to give up type safety.</p>

<p>So, my preferred solution here is obvious, if boring: just use exceptions like
C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, and most other languages do. It&rsquo;s been
proven successful, and it&rsquo;s familiar to millions of programmers. It&rsquo;s popular
for a reason.</p>

<h2>Generics</h2>

<p>Go may be the only static language created in the past decade that <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em>
have generics and the lack is a painful omission. Programmers skilled in C++,
Java, and C# (not to mention the ML family!) have learned that you can write
code that is both flexible <em>and</em> type-safe using type polymorphism. The absence
of it in Go takes a major tool out of the toolbox.</p>

<p>One clear example of how onerous its absence is the vector type in Go. There are
three separate vector types, one for <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/e6ecf9765ae8aca669f192aff9a112b6fa10dfcb/src/pkg/container/vector/intvector.go">ints</a>, one for <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/e6ecf9765ae8aca669f192aff9a112b6fa10dfcb/src/pkg/container/vector/stringvector.go">strings</a>, and one for
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/e6ecf9765ae8aca669f192aff9a112b6fa10dfcb/src/pkg/container/vector/vector.go"><code>interface{}</code></a>. You&rsquo;ll notice the code for all three is identical
except for the types. Indeed:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="c">// CAUTION: If this file is not vector.go, it was generated</span>
<span class="c">// automatically from vector.go - DO NOT EDIT in that case!</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a clearer indicator that a feature is missing. Actually, I can:
<code>map</code>. Go has a hashtable collection type which <em>is</em> generic, precisely because
it&rsquo;s built into the language. It&rsquo;s special.</p>

<p>The rationale I&rsquo;ve read (&ldquo;one map is all you need&rdquo;) feels out of place in Go.
It&rsquo;s <em>only</em> in low-level languages like C and C++ that I&rsquo;ve had strange
requirements that prevented me from using standard components. I can understand
that reasoning in Java or C#, but in a systems language I&rsquo;d be honestly
surprised if one map <em>was</em> all I needed.</p>

<p>The solution&mdash;adding generics to the language&mdash;is certainly non-trivial, but
it isn&rsquo;t rocket science either. There&rsquo;s a slew of existing languages with
support for generics out there, and a wide body of literature to pull from.</p>

<p>As strange as it sounds, something like C++ templates are probably the closest
fit for Go: they play nice with value types, give excellent runtime performance,
and can lean on the fact that Go compiles really fast. By not being bound to C&rsquo;s
syntax and antiquated textual <code>#include</code> compilation model, I believe Go could
get much of the power of templates while still being simpler and less finicky
than C++.</p>

<h2>Future-proofing</h2>

<p>Bertrand Meyer coined something he calls the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_access_principle">uniform access principle</a>"
which states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All services offered by a module should be available through a uniform
notation, which does not betray whether they are implemented through storage
or through computation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, a built-in field on a type should be indistinguishable at the
use site from a calculated property. This is important because it lets you start
simple using direct fields but then replace them with calculated properties
later without having to touch every callsite.</p>

<p>In languages that don&rsquo;t support this, like Java, you end up speculatively
wrapping <em>everything</em> in an abstraction (in this case getters and setters) just
<em>in case</em> you find yourself needing that later. I consider this
<a href="/2010/09/18/futureproofing-uniform-access-and-masquerades/">future-proofing</a> and I think it&rsquo;s one of the biggest sources of the detested
boilerplate that led the designers to create Go in the first place.</p>

<h3>Other kinds of future-proofing</h3>

<p>Uniform access talks just about properties but I consider that part of a much
larger question: &ldquo;Can I replace built-in functionality with a user-defined
abstraction without having to change each callsite?&rdquo; Wherever the answer is
&ldquo;no&rdquo;, you find boilerplate. For example, in most languages a constructor call
must always return the named type henceforth and forever. To get around that,
you see people hide them behind abstract factories or factory methods.</p>

<p>Reducing boilerplate has been called out as a major motivator behind Go, and you
can see they&rsquo;ve taken steps towards mitigating future-proofing. An existing type
can retroactively implement a new interface, which is really cool. Likewise, you
can add methods to existing types.</p>

<p>But for many other things, Go has taken steps <em>backwards</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Field access</strong> is different from method calls (which always take <code>()</code>).
You can&rsquo;t make a calculated property that looks like a field, unlike C# and
most dynamic languages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Subscript syntax</strong> like <code>array[index]</code> cannot be overloaded (unlike C++
and C#). This means that if you start off using an array, slice, or a map
and later decide to used a higher-level collection, you&rsquo;ll have to touch
every callsite.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Object allocation</strong> uses special <code>new</code> syntax and can only zero-initialize
the object. If you later need more complex initialization, you&rsquo;ll have to
replace every <code>new(Foo)</code> call with <code>NewFoo()</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The solutions for these are fairly straightforward: allow users to overload the
syntax. In all cases, all that needs to happen is that some piece of Go syntax
gets desugared to a regular method or function call. The way to specify these
&ldquo;special&rdquo; methods is a <a href="http://www.bikeshed.com/">bikeshed</a> question, but something like this would work
without adding any keywords:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="c">// Property getter like `vector.Magnitude`:</span>
<span class="k">func</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="i">vector</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="t">Vector</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="i">Magnitude__get__</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="i">float</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c">// Calculate the magnitude of a vector...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">// Property setter like `rect.Width = 4`:</span>
<span class="k">func</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="i">rect</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="t">Rect</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="i">Width__set__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">value</span> <span class="t">int</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c">// Set the width of the rectangle...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">// Subscript operator like `list[index]`:</span>
<span class="k">func</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="i">s</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="t">StringList</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="i">Subscript__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">index</span> <span class="t">int</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="t">string</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c">// Get the element at index...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">// Subscript operator in assignment like `list[index] = &quot;value&quot;`:</span>
<span class="k">func</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="i">s</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="t">StringList</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="i">SubscriptSet__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">index</span> <span class="t">int</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="i">value</span> <span class="t">string</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="t">string</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c">// Set the element at index to value...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">// Initialization function automatically called after `new(Thing)`</span>
<span class="c">// creates a zero-valued object.</span>
<span class="k">func</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="i">t</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="t">Thing</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="i">Init__</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c">// Initialize the value...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Minimalists will argue that this just adds needless complexity to the language.
My only counter-argument is that it was Java&rsquo;s attempts to <em>simplify</em> C++ that
leads to code like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="i">book</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="i">getChapters</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="i">put</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="i">book</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="i">getChapters</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="i">size</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">1</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="t">ChapterFactory</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="i">instance</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="i">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Prologue&quot;</span><span class="p">));</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Instead of:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="i">book</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="i">chapters</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="i">book</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="i">chapters</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="i">size</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">1</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="t">Chapter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Prologue&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Sometimes a little syntactic sugar goes a long way.</p>

<p>Right now, Go avoids this by having a culture of not future-proofing. That
culture is only sustainable as long as all of the code that your code touches is
very easy for you to modify. That&rsquo;s true within some small or very agile
organizations, but once Go starts moving to wider enterprise use, I fear we&rsquo;ll
start seeing &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; like &ldquo;always wrap every field in a getter method&rdquo;
and &ldquo;always hide constructors behind <code>New__</code>&rdquo; functions and then it&rsquo;s Java all
over again.</p>

<h2>Where to go from here</h2>

<p>If you made it this far, I owe you a beer or something. So, where does this long
piece of armchair language design leave us?</p>

<p>For you, if the language I&rsquo;ve described sounds like what you want, you may
want to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/repos-bitc/bitc">BitC</a>. John Shapiro has recently kicked the dust
off of it and started working on it again. It aims to go much farther down the
path of low-level control + modern types than other languages I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>

<div class="update">
<p><em>Update 2021/10/17:</em> BitC is dead, but today the low-level systems
language that scratches almost all of the itches here is clearly
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>If you just want a low-level language with lots of expressive tools and most of
the features I listed here, then there&rsquo;s always C++. The stuff that&rsquo;s bad about
it is still there, and still bad, but it&rsquo;s the only game in town if you want
control over memory and generics.</p>

<p>For me, I&rsquo;m gonna get back to working on <a href="https://magpie-lang.org/">my little language</a>.
Meanwhile, if there&rsquo;s anything here that the Go community is interested in, I&rsquo;m
more than up for the challenge of actually implementing it.</p>
