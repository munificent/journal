title: "New Game Programming Patterns Chapters Up!"
tags: cpp game-patterns

I've finally gotten a chance to get some new chapters online for *[Game
Programming Patterns][]*. They've been done for a while, but I had to get the
rubber stamp from the Powers That Be before I could put them up. They are:

[game programming patterns]: http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/

  * [Service Locator](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/service-locator.html)

  * [Type Object](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/type-object.html)

  * [Double Buffer](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/double-buffer.html)

With this, I think I'm about a quarter of the way through what looks to be a
monster of a book. It's over 30,000 words already. I don't know whether to be
proud of how much I've got done or terrified by how much is left to do.
