<div class="update">
<p><em>Update 2011/08/16:</em> This post is about an older version of the blog. I used to use WordPress and redesigned the template a while back.
</p>
</div>
<p>I just finished redoing the template for this here blog thing, and the most
significant change is that there are no longer comments on it.</p>
<p>I reached this decision starting from a simple engineering observation: a good
piece of software does <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint_Exup%C3%A9ry" title="Perfection is attained, not when no more can be added, but when no more can be removed.">few things</a> and does them well. A program
shouldn&rsquo;t re-invent things, and it certainly shouldn&rsquo;t re-invent them <em>poorly</em>.
Looking at it like that, it&rsquo;s obvious that the core feature of the blog is my
text (whether that feature <em>sucks</em> or not I&rsquo;ll leave up to you). The comment
engine is peripheral, and, frankly, not very well done. There&rsquo;s no threading,
up/down-voting, user information, good formatting, etc. It&rsquo;s pretty lame.</p>
<p>So I figured it would be better to re-use an existing comment system. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>
is <a href="http://code.reddit.com/">open source</a> so I could, in theory, use that. But thinking
about it a bit more, the obvious problem is that the best feature of reddit (and
<a href="http://digg.com/">digg</a>&rsquo;s, <a href="http://www.dzone.com">dzone</a>&rsquo;s, etc.) comment systems isn&rsquo;t the <em>code</em>, it&rsquo;s the
<em>people</em>. So the solution is simple: take comments off my blog and just direct
people to comment on one of those sites. Odds are good that they&rsquo;re already a
member of one or more of them anyway so there&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t a lot of hassle there.</p>
<h2 id="downsides"><a href="#downsides">Downsides<span class="anchor">#downsides</span></a></h2>
<p>One of the obvious downsides is that conversation about what I write is no
longer on my territory. I lose the ability to moderate them or decide how long
they&rsquo;re online. If reddit kills the thread for one of my posts there&rsquo;s nothing I
can do about it. If some guy on digg thinks I&rsquo;m an ass, I&rsquo;m powerless to silence
him.</p>
<p>If I cared about traffic or &ldquo;stickiness&rdquo; or something it might also bother me
that people will no longer come to <em>my</em> site to see further comments. They&rsquo;ll go
to reddit, or digg, or wherever.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t care about any of those. Honestly, traffic to my server is a net
negative. Bandwidth costs me money. What motivates me is writing, and having
people read it and discuss it. Deleting spam comments is not how I get my rocks
off.</p>
<h2 id="upside"><a href="#upside">Upside<span class="anchor">#upside</span></a></h2>
<p>From that perspective, offloading comments makes a lot of sense. My little
<a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> blog can&rsquo;t hope to provide a comment UI anywhere near as good as
most news aggregators out there. Every time I saw someone posting a comment with
code on my blog followed by another comment apologizing for the way WordPress
ate its formatting, I cringed. Now I don&rsquo;t have that problem: reddit has
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.</p>
<p>Likewise, I don&rsquo;t have to moderate comments anymore. News aggregators are
centered almost precisely on that problem and they do it far better than I can.</p>
<p>More importantly, they provide a better community for discussing my writing than
I can. It&rsquo;s a bit odd, but more people will comment about a blog post of mine on
another site than they will on the post itself. The logic is obvious. You don&rsquo;t
get reddit karma for commenting on my blog <em>on my blog</em> but you do if you
comment on it on reddit. Since commenting on another site is clearly better, I
may as well make it the <em>only</em> choice.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-downside"><a href="#the-real-downside">The real downside<span class="anchor">#the-real-downside</span></a></h2>
<p>There is one very real bad part about the change, though. If you&rsquo;ve been kind
enough to comment on my blog before, your comment is no longer online. This
isn&rsquo;t because your comments weren&rsquo;t good. The quality of comments I received was
always stellar, even when you fought with the limitations of the system. I&rsquo;m
sorry your words are no longer up here.</p>
