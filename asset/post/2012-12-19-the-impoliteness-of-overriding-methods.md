title: "The Impoliteness of Overriding Methods"

Over the weekend, I was reading one of the shagadelic papers on [Self][],
[Parents are Shared Parts of Objects: Inheritance and Encapsulation in
SELF][paper]. What can I say, I have a weird idea of fun. If you're interested
in prototypes, or you're a Javascripter -- but I repeat myself -- you owe it to
yourself to read these papers. They are gems.

[paper]: http://selflanguage.org/documentation/published/parents-shared-parts.html

But this post isn't about prototypes, it's about something the Self folks
mention in passing:

> In BETA, virtual functions are invoked from least specific to most specific,
> with the keyword `inner` being used to invoke the next more specific method.
> This mechanism is a product of the philosophy in BETA that subclasses should
> be behavioral extensions to their superclasses and therefore specialize the
> behavior of their superclasses at well-defined points (i.e. at calls to
> `inner`).

It took me a while to tease out what this is saying, but once I did, it was like
a dim little light bulb flickered on in my head.

## What's BETA?

Before I get into the lightbulb part, a bit of history. [BETA][] is a language
that came out of the "Scandinavian School" in Denmark, the [same people][] that
brought you [Simula][] and kicked off the object-oriented revolution. Alan Kay
may have coined "object-oriented programming", but it was Simula that gave him
the idea. Chances are, the language you should be coding in right now instead of
slacking off reading my blog was directly inspired by these guys.

[beta]: http://daimi.au.dk/~beta
[same people]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Nygaard
[simula]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula

So after Simula, they went off and made BETA. I think this is more or less
equivalent to "famous rock band goes into hiding for ten years and emerges with
avant garde free jazz album". BETA was used as a teaching language, I think, and
there were some papers about it, but I don't know if many people seriously used
it in anger.

(Trivia time! Some of the guys who made [V8][], the famously-fast JavaScript
engine in Chrome *did* use BETA. "V8" got its name because it's the eighth
virtual machine that Lars Bak created. His first VM? A BETA one.)

Part of the reason BETA didn't flourish may have to do with terminology. Instead
of *classes* and *methods*, BETA has *patterns* which subsume both, somehow, and
aren't related to other uses of the term in other languages. I wrote that
sentence, and I don't even know what the hell that means.

The [BETA book](http://daimi.au.dk/~beta/Books/index.html#betabook_download) is
a bit... dense. Or maybe it's just that the syntax is so *weird*:

```text
Account:
  (# balance: @integer;
    Deposit:
      (# amount: @integer
      enter amount
      do balance+amount->balance
      exit balance
      #);

    Withdraw:
      (# amount: @integer
      enter amount
      do balance-amount->balance
      exit balance
      #);
  #)
```

I pride myself on being able to grok syntax on a pretty wide variety of
languages but I'm not even sure what's a *comment* there. I *think* if you
translated that to JavaScript, it would be something like:

```javascript
var account = {
  balance: undefined,

  deposit: function(amount) {
    return this.balance += amount;
  },

  withdraw: function(amount) {
    return this.balance -= amount;
  }
};
```

Like avant garde jazz, this may be genius, but it's so out there and
unapproachable, it's hard to tell. Fortunately, the Self guys have deciphered
some of the mystery and left that little nugget in their paper.

## Overriding and `super()`

Let's cover one last bit of context before I get to the point. If you're using
any object-oriented language, you're hopefully familiar with overriding methods.
Details vary between languages, but the two main points are:

1.  A subclass can *override* a method in its superclass. When you invoke the
    method on an instance of the subclass, the derived method gets called
    *first*.

2.  In the body of the overriding method, you can invoke the base class method
    directly in order to chain the two methods together. In Java, you do so by
    calling `super.someMethod()`. In C# it's `base.someMethod()`. In CLOS, you
    use `call-next-method`. You get the idea.

I'm using class terminology here, but all of the above applies equally well to
prototypal languages too, with a couple of names changed.

Here's an example:

```java
class Account {
  int balance = 0;
  int deposit(int amount) {
    return balance += amount;
  }
}

class CrappyBankAccount extends Account {
  int deposit(int amount) {
    // Service charge, sucker!
    CrappyBank.mainAccount.deposit(2);
    super.deposit(amount - 2);
  }
}
```

So now, if you do something like this:

```java
Account account = new CrappyBankAccount();
account.deposit(23);
```

First, it invokes `CrappyBankAccount#deposit()`. Then, when that calls
`super.deposit()`, it chains to the base `Account#deposit()` method.

## Who's in charge here?

What this means is that the *subclass* is in control of the dispatch chain. When
you override a method in Java, you get to decide if you do stuff before calling
`super` or after. You can change the arguments you pass to it, or even skip
calling it entirely.

This is great for flexibility, but as an API designer, that can be frustrating.
When I'm making a class that's designed to be subclassed, I often have
constraints that I want my class to ensure. For example:

```java
class GameObject {
  float x, y;

  void render(Renderer renderer) {
    renderer.setTransform(x, y);
  }
}

class ScaryMonster extends GameObject {
  void render(Renderer renderer) {
    super.render(renderer);
    renderer.drawImage(Images.SCARY_MONSTER);
  }
}
```

Here we're making a game with a base class for a character in the world. It
provides a default `render()` method that tells the renderer where to render.
The subclass overrides it and draws the specific image that's appropriate for
that character.

There's an implied requirement here: if you override `render()` in a subclass,
you *must* call `super.render()` *before* you do any drawing. If you don't, the
transform won't be set and it'll draw wrong.

These hidden requirements rub me the wrong way. If you're implementing a
subclass of `GameObject`, how are you supposed to know that you need to do that?
You can document it, but it would be better if the base class itself made sure
you did the right thing.

## `render()` and `onRender()`

To solve this, what I (and lots of other people) do is split these into two
methods, like so:

```java
class GameObject {
  float x, y;

  void render(Renderer renderer) {
    renderer.setTransform(x, y);
    onRender(renderer);
  }

  protected abstract void onRender();
}

class ScaryMonster extends GameObject {
  protected void onRender(Renderer renderer) {
    renderer.drawImage(Images.SCARY_MONSTER);
  }
}
```

Our public `render()` method is now designed to *not* be overridden. (In C++ or
C# you'd make it non-virtual.) It does the setup it needs and calls the
protected abstract `onRender()` method. That method *is* intended to be
overridden, and by making it protected and abstract, it's clear you *must*
override it. Marking it abstract also makes it clear that you don't need to call
`super()`.

This lets the base class stay in control of the dispatch process. It can do
setup before and after the subclass's "overridden" method gets called. The
dispatch order is reversed now. When you call `render()`, you hit the superclass
*first* and then it calls `onRender()` in the subclass.

This is almost always how I design classes that I intend to be subclassed. It's
rare that I override methods in my code that aren't abstract, and I've been on
teams with style guides that enforced this pattern.

## Back to BETA

Of course, the problem with this is that it *is* a pattern. You have to make a
pair of methods, and every time you have another level of subclassing, you need
a new name. (If there was a subclass of `ScaryMonster` that wanted to override
`onRender()` then `ScaryMonster` would have to add a `onOnRender()`.) This
brings us back to BETA.

Overriding methods in BETA works exactly like this pattern, but baked right into
the language. Instead of calling `super()` in the *derived* class, you call
`inner()` in the *base* class. That tells it to chain *down* to the subclass at
that point.

When you invoke an overridden method, dispatch starts at the *base* class (just
like we want in the `GameObject` example) and then walks down to the subclasses
at the superclass's whim. In other words, our example with BETA-style overriding
would look like:

```java
class GameObject {
  float x, y;

  void render(Renderer renderer) {
    renderer.setTransform(x, y);
    inner(renderer);
  }
}

class ScaryMonster extends GameObject {
  void render(Renderer renderer) {
    renderer.drawImage(Images.SCARY_MONSTER);
  }
}
```

If you chain more than two levels of subclasses, BETA scales better because you
don't need to keep coming up with new names. It has some other neat attributes
too.

```java
class GameObject {
  float x, y;

  void render(Renderer renderer) {
    renderer.setTransform(x, y);
    inner(renderer);
    renderer.restoreState();
  }
}

class ScaryMonster extends GameObject {
  void render(Renderer renderer) {
    renderer.drawImage(Images.SCARY_MONSTER);
  }
}
```

Here, we've added a call to `restoreState()` after the call to `inner()`. By
giving control of the dispatch to the base class, it can execute code both
before *and* after the derived class code. `super()` doesn't let you do that.
(Though `super()` does let you handle the opposite case: you can put code before
and after the *base* class code in the derived method that calls `super()`.)

It also gives you a convenient way to control which methods are virtual and
which aren't. If a method doesn't call `inner()` it implicitly can't be
overridden since it cedes no control to a subclass.

What this means is that base classes have explicit control over how they can be
extended. Outside of programming, "override" has negative connotations: it means
you're hijacking something without its consent and indeed overriding does kind
of work like that in most languages.

In the early days of class-based OOP, people thought any old class could be
spontaneously subclassed. You could just override some stuff and it would all
magically work out. What we've realized over time is that the API you expose to
subclasses is another boundary layer that needs to be carefully designed. Ad-hoc
subclassing rarely works and classes need to be carefully designed up front in
order to be subclassed.

BETA was designed around that model. With typical Scandinavian politeness, you
don't *override* your base class, you politely request permission to extend it.
I think right now, the style of a lot of object-oriented code today fits that
model better.

Most languages chose a different path than BETA, but this makes me wonder if
Kristen and company had it right all along.
