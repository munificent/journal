When I'm designing software, I spend a lot of time thinking about names. For me,
thinking about names is inseparable from the process of design. To name
something is to define it.

One of the ways I know a design has really clicked is when the names feel right.
It may take some time for this to happen (I rename things a *lot* when I'm first
putting them down in code), but that's OK. Good design doesn't happen fast.

Of course, good names alone don't make a good design, but it's been my
experience that crappy names do *prevent* one. With that in mind, here's the
guidelines I try to follow when naming things. The examples here are in C++, but
work more or less for any object-oriented language.

## Types (classes, interfaces, structs)

### The name should be a noun phrase.

```text
Bad:  Happy
Good: Happiness
```

### Do not use namespace-like prefixes.

That's what namespaces are for.

```text
Bad:  SystemOnlineMessage
Good: System::Online::Message
```

### Use just enough adjectives to be clear.

```text
Bad:  IAbstractFactoryPatternBase
Good: IFactory
```

### Do not use "Manager" or "Helper" or other null words in a type name.

If you need to add "Manager" of "Helper" to a type name, the type is either
poorly named or poorly designed. Likely the latter. Types should manage and help
themselves.

```text
Bad:  ConnectionManager
      XmlHelper
Good: Connection
      XmlDocument, XmlNode, etc.
```

### If a class doesn't represent something concrete, consider a metaphor.

```text
Bad:  IncomingMessageQueue
      CharacterArray
      SpatialOrganizer
Good: Mailbox
      String
      Map
```

### If you use a metaphor, use it consistently.

```text
Bad:  Mailbox, DestinationID
Good: Mailbox, Address
```

## Functions (methods, procedures)

### Be terse.

```text
Bad:  list.GetNumberOfItems();
Good: list.Count();
```

### Don't be too terse.

```text
Bad:  list.Verify();
Good: list.ContainsNull();
```

### Avd abbrvtn.

```text
Bad:  list.Srt();
Good: list.Sort();
```

### Name functions that do things using verbs.

```text
Bad:  obj.RefCount();
Good: list.Clear();
      list.Sort();
      obj.AddReference();
```

### Name functions that return a Boolean (i.e. predicates) like questions.

```text
Bad:  list.Empty();
Good: list.IsEmpty();
      list.Contains(item);
```

### Name functions that return a value and don't change state using nouns.

```text
Bad:  list.GetCount();
Good: list.Count();
```

(In C#, you'd actually use properties for this.)

### Don't make the name redundant with an argument.

```text
Bad:  list.AddItem(item);
      handler.ReceiveMessage(msg);
Good: list.Add(item);
      handler.Receive(msg);
```

### Don't make the name redundant with the receiver.

```text
Bad:  list.AddToList(item);
Good: list.Add(item);
```

### Only describe the return in the name if there are identical functions that return different types.

```text
Bad:  list.GetCountInt();
Good: list.GetCount();
      message.GetIntValue();
      message.GetFloatValue();
```

### Don't use "and" or "or" in a function name.

If you're using a conjunction in the name, the function is likely doing too
much. Break it into smaller pieces and name accordingly. If you want to ensure
this is an atomic operation, consider creating a name for that entire operation,
or possibly a class that encapsulates it.

```text
Bad:  mail.VerifyAddressAndSendStatus();
Good: mail.VerifyAddress();
      mail.SendStatus();
```

## Does it matter?

Yes, I firmly believe it does. A module with well-named parts quickly teaches
you what it does. By reading only a fraction of the code, you'll quickly build a
complete mental model of the whole system. If it calls something a "Mailbox"
you'll expect to see "Mail", and "Addresses" without having to read the code for
them.

Well-named code is easier to talk about with other programmers, helping
knowledge of the code to spread. No one wants to try to say
"ISrvMgrInstanceDescriptorFactory" forty times in a meeting.

Over on the other side, poor names create an opaque wall of code, forcing you to
painstakingly run the program in the your head, observe its behavior and then
create your own private nomenclature. "Oh, `DoCheck()` looks like it's iterating
through the connections to see if they're all live. I'll call that
`AreConnectionsLive()`." Not only is this slow, it's non-transferrable.

From the code I've seen, there's a strong correspondence between a cohesive set
of names in a module, and a cohesive module. When I have trouble naming
something, there's a good chance that what I'm trying to name is poorly
*designed*. Maybe it's trying to do too many things at once, or is missing a
critical piece to make it complete.

It's hard to tell if I'm designing well, but one of the surest guides I've found
that I'm *not* doing it well is when the names don't come easy. When I design
now, I try to pay attention to that. Once I'm happy with the names, I'm usually
happy with the design.
